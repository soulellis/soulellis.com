			<em>Chancebooks</em> is a publishing-on-demand experiment using Wikipedia and chance operations. Each <em>Chancebook</em> is a one-of-a-kind assemblage of up to 100 randomly pulled articles from Wikipedia. The selection and sequence of content is generated in real-time as I repeatedly click the &ldquo;random article&rdquo; button that appears on all Wikipedia pages, and add each individual page to the book. The total number of articles is determined by pulling a random number (1&ndash;100) at random.org.
<br>
<br>

			The title is selected from the list of article titles.

			Only one copy of each <em>Chancebook</em> exists, printed on-demand and delivered to me. The book&rsquo;s design is automated and determined by the print-on-demand service. Included within each book are my location and exact date and time of the book&rsquo;s creation.
