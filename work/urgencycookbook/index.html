			<em>URGENCY COOKBOOK</em> is a collaborative publication in 80 parts, authored and hand-drawn by the students of <a href="https://soulellis.com/teaching/urgencylab/index.html" target="_blank">Urgency Lab</a>, a 12-week studio course taught by Paul Soulellis at Rhode Island School of Design. <em>URGENCY COOKBOOK</em> documents the language that evolved during the class in spring 2019, with ingredients and recipes for collective care&mdash;presented as terms, definitions, quotes, drawings, photos, and stories.

			Many of the terms included in <em>URGENCY COOKBOOK</em> originally appeared in an &ldquo;urgency map&rdquo; that the class created in week 4 of the semester. During week 8, the students re-created the map off-campus as a mural, in my studio space in Pawtucket, using pens, paper, and tape. In weeks 10 and 11, we gathered all of the terms from the map into a google doc and collaboratively wrote definitions, quotes, references, and notes, and expanded the list into a glossary/lexicon. In week 11, we collectively hand-wrote the entire doc onto a set of 80 cards, adding drawings, hand-lettering, and other material. These cards were then used to print <em>URGENCY COOKBOOK</em>.
