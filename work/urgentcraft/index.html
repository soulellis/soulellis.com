<h3>			
			<em>URGENTCRAFT</em> is a set of principles that works to resist oppression-based design ideologies, especially in art and design education. URGENTCRAFT isn&rsquo;t a manifesto, but rather a constellation of tactics &mdash; a series of incomplete observations. A note to self. <em>A reminder that we can use art and design to loosen hegemonic power.</em>

			The print was originally made to accompany the talk <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLnHQq2VjPrsRRB_wA-DTmHsRBreET09e-ZpT-j-ez0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">&ldquo;URGENCRAFT,&rdquo;</a> delivered at the <a href="https://vimeo.com/354276810" target="_blank">eyeo festival</a> in June 2019 (and revised in April 2020, <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/urgentcraft2/" target="_blank">self-published</a> and at <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/on-the-power-of-mutual-aid-publishing-during-crisis/" target="_blank">The Creative Independent,</a> in response to COVID-19). The talk outlines these principles and provides examples of artists and writers who manifest these ideas. It was reprinted as an edition of 200 in August 2019 and included in <a href="https://queer.archive.work/3/index.html" target="_blank">QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK #3</a> for distribution at the NY Art Book Fair.
