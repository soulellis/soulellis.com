			<em>Survival by Sharing (scenes and provocations)</em> is a 16-page zine containing the text of a talk delivered on June 17, 2023 at the Korean Society of Typography conference &ldquo;Publishing as a Worldview,&rdquo; at Platform-P, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 100 copies of the zine were printed at Binch/Queer.Archive.Work in Providence, RI and an edition of 50 was distributed to the audience at the talk in Seoul. The text describes a publishing ethos, told in a series of scenes, non-chronologically. It&rsquo;s a cinematic timeline, told in queer time.

			From the zine:
			<br>
			<br>
			<em>I invite you to go looking, in the floorboards, down the street, in the library, in the database, on your networks, for the bad archives that surround us, neglected images and artifacts that deserve our attention. 
			<br>
			<br>				
			Make your own bad archives. When we look closely, these artifacts flowing through time connect us to past and future worlds. They reveal us. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This talk was a messy assemblage, each part a scene that describes an impulse to save and to survive through small acts of sharing, each one a small view of a world that wasn&rsquo;t meant to continue. I&rsquo;ve mixed up publishing, archives, AI, and time travel in ways that might not be entirely legible. This talk describes my illegitimate publishing practice, and it&rsquo;s a proposal for you to consider publishing as a small view. A provocation, to consider publishing as localized world building. 
			<br>
			<br>
			And please, consider this talk itself as a kind of bad archive. A history told through a collection of moments where queer life persists through technology and the impulse to save outside the institution, to contain that which capitalism and heteropatriarchy demand we forget. Scenes that &ldquo;articulate the importance of assembling material objects: words, paper, evidence&rdquo; (<a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:29892/datastreams/CONTENT/content?download=true" type="_blank">Laura E. Helton</a>). This talk is a view from the future, into the future, spanning exactly 100 years, to connect us to <u>the then and there of queer futurity,</u> a kind of time travel where we get to be in conversation with ancestors, as we prepare ourselves to become ancestors.</em>
