			I founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_the_Printed_Web" target="_blank">Library of the Printed Web</a> in 2013 to investigate web-to-print artistic practice and the increasingly &fllig;uid relationship between screen and printed page. It began as a small collection of mainly self-published artists&rsquo; publications that I acquired directly from artists and small publishers. It quickly grew, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-artful-accidents-of-google-books" target="_blank">attracted attention</a>, and became the subject of international <a href="https://upforgallery.com/variable-states/" target="_blank">exhibitions</a>, <a href="http://newhive.com/soulellis/merz" target="_blank">workshops</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/96574475" target="_blank">research</a>, and <a href="http://circulationexchange.org/assets/pdfs/Senior_Hamerman_ScreenLife_ShelfLife.pdf" target="_blank">discourse</a>. In 2014, I began publishing my own artistsâ€™ publications through Library of the Printed Web (<a href="../printedweb1/index.html"><em>Printed Web 1</em></a>, <a href="../printedweb2/index.html"><em>2</em></a>, <a href="../printedweb3/index.html"><em>3</em></a>, <a href="../printedweb4/index.html"><em>4</em></a>, <a href="../printedweb5/index.html"><em>5</em></a>, <a href="https://queer.archive.work"><em>6</em></a> and <a href="../printedweb_editions/index.html">Printed Web Editions</a>), regularly featuring new work by a range of web-to-print artists in various print-on-demand forms. 
<br>
<br>
			By 2017, Library of the Printed Web had evolved to become an important resource for the study of print-based experimental publishing in the early 21st century. The collection was acquired by The Museum of Modern Art Library in New York in January 2017.

			Included in MoMA&rsquo;s acquisition were 244 items by 130 artists publishing in 17 countries&mdash;artists&rsquo; books, zines, newsprint, loose sheets, folios, prints, postcards, and other materials. A comprehensive <a href="lotpw_book.html" target="_blank">catalogue</a> was published in fall 2017, with contributions by David Senior and Sarah Hamerman of MoMA Library, and artist Sal Randolph.

<br>
			Library of the Printed Web entered MoMA Library as a self-contained archive (<a href="https://arcade.nyarc.org/search~S8/?searchtype=c&searcharg=lpw&searchscope=8" target="_blank">including its own call number designation &ldquo;LPW&rdquo; in MoMA&rsquo;s Dadabase</a>), to be preserved in its entirety for years to come. The project is available for institutional loan, and accessible to the general public at MoMA&rsquo;s midtown Manhattan location for viewing and research (by appointment). Many of the works are rare or no longer available. Most are self-published, including handmade, one-of-a-kind, limited editions, as well as many print-on-demand works.
