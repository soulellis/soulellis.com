            This talk describes a publishing practice, told in a series of scenes, non-chronologically. It's a cinematic timeline, told in queer time. Recently, I was in a very bad accident. I tripped in the street and started flying through the air. I landed and broke 12 bones. For a long time, I couldn’t move around. I couldn’t go to school where I was needed, where I’m the head of the graphic design department. I couldn’t go to the studio where I do my work and where I help organize community. For several months, I had a lot of time to reflect. I tried to understand what had happened, and one of the ways I did this was by making these images. I started feeding the details of my accident into a text-to-image generator. I wanted to reconstruct the accident, so I could see it from outside my body. I wanted to see if these images could reveal something about the event, like evidence. Maybe it could show me what had really happened. Maybe I could learn something about my experience that my memory couldn’t provide. I generated thousands of these images; it started to resemble an archive. This was my way of slowing down what had happened. I wanted to occupy the space of that moment, and it felt like this tool could help me.
