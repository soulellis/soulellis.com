			<em>530 (S&aacute; veldur sem &aacute; heldur)</em> is a site-speci&filig;c book work completed at Nes, an artist&rsquo;s residency in Skagastr&ouml;nd, Iceland (Julyâ€“September 2013).
<br>
<br>

			The book expresses a series of connected encounters with people, places, things, stories and data in the remote &filig;shing village. 530 refers to the village&rsquo;s population (according to Wikipedia), as well as a number that appears on a 1955 fishing trawler docked in Skagastr&ouml;nd&rsquo;s harbor (Hafr&uacute;n). It is also the number of pages in the book.

			<em>S&aacute; veldur sem &aacute; heldur</em> is an Icelandic expression that a village resident used in conversation to describe the future of the town, in relation to its rich sea resources. It roughly translates to &ldquo;the one who holds it is the one who is responsible.&rdquo; I adopted the expression to refer to the book form itself, in the hands of the reader.

			The work was created using a score of 39 movements that were arranged by chance operations. The sections move in and out of each other, sometimes overlapping or merging.

			<em>530</em> was printed by Svansprent in Reykjav&iacute;k, in an edition of 50. Most of the books were given away in a series of book encounters in the town during my final week in residency. I gave it to townspeople portrayed in the work, people who supported the project, and to people encountered by chance in the town&rsquo;s public spaces during the encounters.
