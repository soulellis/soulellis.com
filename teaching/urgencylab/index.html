				How do we address what&rsquo;s truly urgent today? Urgent for whom? Crisis conditions have infused every aspect of culture and society, but the role and efficacy of art and design as a means for change is still debated. We&rsquo;ll begin this studio course by defining what Urgency Lab is on our own terms, casting a wide view towards climate, gender, race, and oppression. Can artists and designers loosen hegemonic power? We&rsquo;ll engage with a range of voices for guidance and inspiration through weekly studio visits and readings, both within and outside art and design discourse, with a particular emphasis on queer methodologies and historically marginalized perspectives. We&rsquo;ll draw upon Fred Moten and Stefano Harney&rsquo;s concept of the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bm8pdoz42mss9q7/undercommons-web.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"><em>undercommons</em></a> as a way to imagine Urgency Lab&rsquo;s own position with an institutional context, and as the course progresses we&rsquo;ll build our own &ldquo;urgency network&rdquo;&mdash;tools, references, modalities, and scenarios&mdash;to help us speculate, imagine, and articulate a more just futurity.   
<br>
<br>
				What is urgent craft? The semester will be devoted to the creation of Urgency Lab as a collective effort, so determining the Lab&rsquo;s form, scope, and output together will itself be an experiment in collaborative, peer-to-peer making as an act of resistance. Working in public, radical acts of publishing, research-based exploration, rapid prototyping, non-traditional tools and platforms, and experimentation will be encouraged. Let&rsquo;s subvert legacy art and design structures in order to produce new, non-normative narratives.
