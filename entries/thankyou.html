        <p><em>Thank you for your interest in this subject</em> contains a selection of 22 web pages that I collected from whitehouse.gov. The publication presents the last (Obama) and first (Trump) views of the official White House website as cached by the Internet Archive on January 20, 2017, as the Obama administration transitioned to the Trump presidency at approximately 5:00pm. Pages of content related to Civil Rights, Women&rsquo;s Rights, Immigration, Climate Change, LGBTQIA+ Rights, and others were removed and replaced with the message: &ldquo;Thank you for your interest in this subject.&rdquo; In 2018 the Trump administration redesigned whitehouse.gov and replaced the entire site with new visual language and content, and the placeholder page, as it was archived in this publication, was permanently removed (as was the original Obama-era content).</p>
