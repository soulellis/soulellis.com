        <p>16-page zine<br>
            Risograph printing<br>
            Newsprint  <br>
            5.5 in. x 8.5 in.<br>  
            Edition of 100
        </p>

        <p><i>Survival by Sharing</i> (scenes and provocations) describes a publishing ethos, told in a series of scenes, non-chronologically. The writing incorporates ideas about AI, archives, and embodiment. It’s a cinematic timeline, told in queer time. </p> 

        <p>It was first presented as a talk delivered on June 17, 2023 at “Publishing as a Worldview,” the 25th annual conference of the Korean Society of Typography in Seoul, Republic of Korea. An edition of 100 copies of a 16-page newsprint zine containing the text of the talk was printed at Queer.Archive.Work in Providence, RI and hand-carried to Seoul to distribute to the audience at the talk. I reprinted <i>Survival by Sharing</i> and distributed a new edition of 50 copies at Printed Matter’s Sunday Zine Fair at The Brooklyn Museum in November 2023. A new version of the talk was delivered at the University of Missouri, Kansas City in 2024.</p> 

        <p>The essay was also published in <i>LetterSeed 24 New Season: Publishing as a Worldview</i> by the Korean Society of Typography in September 2023.</p>
