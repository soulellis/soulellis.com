        <p>
            Unique, chance-generated book objects<br>
            Print-on-demand<br>
            Perfect bound<br>
            Each in an edition of 1 (unique copies)
        </p>

        <p><em>Chancebooks</em> was a publishing-on-demand experiment using Wikipedia and chance operations. Each <en>Chancebook</en> was a one-of-a-kind assemblage of up to 100 randomly pulled articles from Wikipedia. The selection and sequence of content was generated in real-time as I repeatedly clicked the &ldquo;random article&rdquo; button that appears on all Wikipedia pages, and added each individual page to the book. The total number of articles was determined by pulling a random number (1&ndash;100) at random.org. The title is selected from the list of article titles.</p>

        <p>Only one copy of each Chancebook exists, printed on-demand and delivered to me. The book&rsquo;s design was automated and determined by the print-on-demand service. Included within each book are my location and exact date and time of the book&rsquo;s creation.</p>
