        <p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.lafayetteanticipations.com/en" target="_blank">Fondation Galeries Lafayette</a> held a symposium and workshop in Paris to strategize for the opening of their new headquarters in Le Marais, <a href="https://www.oma.com/projects/fondation-entreprise-galeries-lafayette" target="_blank">designed by OMA</a>. I was invited to participate by leading a workshop and delivering a talk about experimental publishing for the artists, curators, and museum officials who were planning the new building. The talk is organized into four sections&mdash;1 Is posting publishing? 2 Malls, bedrooms and balconies, 3 Designing the place of memory, and 4 Poor media and physical space. Later, these efforts led to the realization of <a href="https://www.lafayetteanticipations.com/fr/latelier-dedition" target="_blank">The Publishing Workshop</a>.</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;Is our publishing platform loosely bound by codes of behavior like a pedestrian navigating a busy street or more tightly controlled, like in an airport. Is there space for surprise or risk&mdash;chaos, even&mdash;Twitter and Reddit come to mind&mdash;or more like a closed, gated community for friends who &lsquo;make public&rsquo; around the performance of identity&mdash;the publishing spaces of Facebook or Slack, or group DMs. Or is it a police state, and maybe this is Wikipedia, where publishing is a highly regulated activity, surveilled and monitored by editors and algorithms who keep ideas formatted and filed, with controlled vocabularies and little or no room for creative expression. Or is it a place of commerce, like Amazon or ebay.  <br><br> Recently, at the New Museum&rsquo;s Ideas City festival in New York, performance artist Penny Arcade said that &lsquo;the strategy of a mall is to fill all possible space, materializing desire and fear, so that visitors have no option but to engage (or leave). A mall is a site of extreme visibility.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not too difficult for me to imagine a publishing scheme with a disposition for making everything available, sharable and ownable; the ability to add anything to the cart. A site of promiscuity, if you will, where everything is networked and possible; I&rsquo;m thinking specifically of Alexander Galloway&rsquo;s Google Deleuzians. Why not. <br><br> The archive as network as mall, as site for infinite desire, curation and availability, where all possible commodities are indexed and exchanged, we could even say purchased, sold or published.&rdquo;</blockquote>
