        <h1>Dear Friend (2023)</h1>


        <p><em>Dear Friend</em> (2019&ndash;2022) was a monthly snail-mail project initiated by Sandra Nuut and Ott Kagovere at the Graphic Design Department of the Estonian Academy of Arts. The publication began as an edition of 100 and later 200 letters each month, which were riso-printed and hand-folded in a collaborative manner. Half of the edition was distributed locally and another half globally, traveling to design institutions, schools, and professionals. My contribution describes the making of <em>resting reader</em> and includes a QR code link to download a PDF of the publication, and was sent out as volume 34 in February 2022. Later in 2022 the entire project was documented in the book <a href="https://lugemik.ee/Dear-Friend-Catalogue" target="_blank"><em>Dear Friend Catalogue</em></a>, published by Lugemik.</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;I’ve been missing you. This morning I woke up before the sun, thinking about you. I knew that I had to write. I miss running into you. I miss meeting you for the first time, seeing you up close, walking beside you, catching up, hanging out, eating breakfast together, seeing your studio, meeting your friends, hearing your voice in the room. In the absence of these things, I listen, and do time travel. It’s a way to keep going. I do it here in the library, finding things and bringing them into the present, so I’ve been thinking about how to share some of that with you. This letter is a small gesture, a gift, a signal, something to send out, something to do when bodies stay home, when we miss it all, and wish for more.&rdquo;</blockquote>
