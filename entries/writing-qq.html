        <p>&ldquo;Quantum Queerness&rdquo; appears in <i>A Queer Year of Love Letters / Alphabets Against Erasure</i>, by Nat Pyper, <a href="https://www.inventorypress.com/product/a-queer-year-of-love-letters" target="_blank">published by Inventory Press and LibraryStack in 2025</a>. &ldquo;The book debuts a new essay by Pyper, and includes contributions from Paul Soulellis, Claire Star Finch, Silas Munro, Lukaza Branfman-Verissimo, Rosen Eveleigh, and G. B. Jones that offer vital perspectives on queer archival practices, language lineages, design as protest, and love as the basis for research. Part reader, part type specimen, part love letter, these fonts foreground the politics of queer memory while opening up new avenues for writers, designers, and curious readers.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;Recently, I was in an accident. I tripped while walking downhill, which caused me to fly headfirst into a stone wall. I broke 12 bones. For an unknown amount of time I lay on the sidewalk, unconscious in public, until I was found by someone who called for help. My body was brought closer to the end of my own timeline, if not quite all the way. I experienced a new, heightened awareness of the boundaries between bodies and timelines, and began to think about what it might mean to become an ancestor myself.&rdquo;</blockquote>
