        <p>My essay &ldquo;Quantum Queerness&rdquo; will appear in <i>A Queer Year of Love Letters / Alphabets Against Erasure</i>, a new book by Nat Pyper, <a href="https://www.inventorypress.com/product/a-queer-year-of-love-letters" target="_blank">forthcoming from Inventory Press in May 2025</a>&mdash;</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;<i>A Queer Year of Love Letters: Alphabets Against Erasure</i> connects font design to queer culture at a time of increasing erasure and suppression of trans and queer histories. Expanding upon a series of openly downloadable fonts whose letterforms derived from the life stories, printed ephemera, and vernacular scripts of countercultural queers from recent decades, this new book showcases their biographies and previously unseen archival materials, as well as digital craft methodology for font design. <br><br> Paul Soulellis writes in his essay “What Is Queer Typography?”: “there is no queer typography, only queer acts of reading and writing,” and this book proposes a kind of compendium for that concept. In addition to a new essay from Soulellis, the book features contributions from Silas Munro, Lukaza Branfman-Verissimo, Claire Finch, and others. Their essays offer emerging perspectives on queer archival practices, DIY lineages, design and politics, and love as the basis for research. This project challenges the field of graphic design, a field of signs, representations, and meaning making, to extend toward undervalued perspectives and overlooked pockets of visual and semiotic history.&rdquo;</blockquote>
