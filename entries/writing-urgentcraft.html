        <p>In 2019 I was invited to deliver back-to-back talks at both the <a href="https://eyeofestival.com/" target="_blank">Eyeo Festival</a> in Minneapolis and <a href="https://2019.theconference.se/" target="_blank">The Conference</a> in Malm&ouml;, Sweden for which I wrote &ldquo;Urgentcraft&rdquo; [<a href="https://vimeo.com/354276810" target="_blank">watch the video here</a>]. I spoke about mutual aid publishing during crisis, urgent artifacts, and how art and design can loosen power. This is the text where I first introduce the set of tactics that I titled <i>urgentcraft</i>, with an open call encouraging others to adopt, adapt, question, and incorporate these principles. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1f6k4zd3zechozs/UC_5.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">A zine version</a> was distributed as part of <i>Queer.Archive.Work #3</i>, along with the risograph print on yellow stock, which was also distributed to the audience at the Eyeo talk.</p> 

        <p>During the initial COVID-19 lockdown I was regularly getting invited to give talks, and I reworked the Urgentcraft talk repeatedly to account for the changing conditions. <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/urgentcraft2/" target="_blank">This version</a> was written for Otis College of Art and Design on April 27, 2020, and <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/urgentcraft3/index.html" target="_blank">this version</a> was written for a talk hosted by Wendy&rsquo;s Subway on the occasion of their online residency with the Libby Leshgold Gallery and READ Books, at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, Canada. In each case I delivered the talk using a hand-coded web page that contained the entire text, images, and links, which was then available to circulate as a URL to the attendees for reference later.</p>

        <p>Urgentcraft
            <ul>
            <li>Do what you can

            <li>Understand the politics of your platforms
            <li>Practice media fluidity
            <li>Work in public (self-publish!)
            <li>Practice a slow approach to fast making
            <li>Acknowledge complexity and contradiction in making
            <li>Work towards the then and there of queer futurity (while acknowledging past struggles and privileges)

            <li>Dismantle white supremacy

            <li>Resist capitalist strategies
            <li>Resist design perfection / stay with the mess
            <li>Question linearity and other hierarchical structures
            <li>Commit to maintenance and self-care as a form of urgency
            <li>Fail to provide the perfect read (resist legibility)
            <li>Use (steal from) the institution when you can (while resisting its values)
            <li>Prioritize communal care as a never-ending practice.
            </ul></p>
