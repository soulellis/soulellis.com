        <p>&ldquo;Notes on Feeds&rdquo; was a piece that I wrote to accompany <em>Printed Web 5: Bot Anthologia</em>, which launched simultaneously at <a href="https://events.brown.edu/literary-arts/event/31571-interrupt-4-a-digital-language-conference" target="_blank"><i>Interrupt 4</i></a> at Brown University, where I delivered the talk, and at <a href="https://eyebeam.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Trust-and-Believe-Handout.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Trust and Believe</i></a> at Eyebeam, a one-day event organized by Nora N. Khan and Sam Hart, where the publication was being distributed. This was the first essay where I sketched out ideas about the post and the feed as forms in network culture, which I further developed in subsequent writings. I self-published the essay as a newsprint broadsheet that was distributed along with <em>Printed Web 5</em>.</p> 

        <blockquote>&ldquo;Today, the coffee pot watches us. We’re observed and heard. In public and in private spaces, and in our own homes. <br><br> As our tolerance for surveillance expands, what it means to watch has shifted. In the new boredom, Horning says, we desire a sort of ‘god’ view as a collective subject, becoming the they who does the observing, instead of the me being seen. Our new position might feel like a kind of safe, removed resistance. A soothing counter to the police state. <br><br> But keeping us watching is part of the deal. Pure, passive consumption&mdash;that somehow feels active and powerful, at the same time. A reverse panopticon, where we participate in the very structures that oppress.&rdquo;</blockquote>
