        <p>&ldquo;Survival by Sharing&rdquo; describes moments of tenderness and generosity in queer publishing, written as a series of scenes, non-chronologically. It&rsquo;s a cinematic timeline, told in queer time. The piece was originally commissioned as a talk for the Korean Society of Typography, delivered on June 17, 2023 at their conference &ldquo;Publishing as Worldview,&rdquo; in Seoul, Republic of Korea. It was then published in the book <em>LetterSeed 24 New Season: Publishing as a Worldview</em> in September 2023. I also published the text as an edition of 50 zines, which were distributed in Seoul. Another edition of 50 was re-printed and distributed freely at Printed Matter&rsquo;s Sunday Zine Fair at The Brooklyn Museum on November 19, 2023.</p>
