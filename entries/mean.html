        <p><i>These Mean Images</i> is a project about the (im)possibility of reparative queer history through generative image-making. During a period of several months I created thousands of photographs using a popular generative image-making tool. I wrote text prompts that asked for images of queerness at different moments in history, and I was especially interested in visualizing situations that were not possible, not allowed, or otherwise not typically included in archives. At the same time, I was generating a large collection of images that tried to visualize a real-world incident that occurred to me in October 2022, where I was injured in an accident and then remained unconscious in public for an unknown period of time.</p> 

        <p><i>These Mean Images</i> tries to locate impossible-to-see moments of vulnerability and tenderness in a blurry <q>other</q> reality of queer becoming. Referencing Hito Steyerl&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images" target="_blank">Mean Images</a>,&rdquo; I remain unconvinced that these images are useful or needed; I wrote about this in <i>Survival by Sharing</i>, concluding that we need to devote more attention to the images and artifacts that are neglected all around us (in archives known and unknown). <q>Mean images</q> do not repair; rather, itâ€™s possible that they may even damage our understanding of queer history. Still, I am fascinated that they now exist, by the relative ease with which they are created, and by their power to change our collective relationship to traditional archives forever.</p>
