        <p>530 (S&aacute; veldur sem &aacute; heldur)</em> is a site-speciﬁc book work completed at <a href="https://neslist.is/" target="_blank">Nes</a>, an artist&rsquo;s residency in Skagastr&ouml;nd, Iceland (July&ndash;September 2013). The book expresses a series of connected encounters with people, places, things, and data in the remote ﬁshing village. 530 refers to the village&rsquo;s population (according to Wikipedia), as well as a number that appears on the 1955 fishing trawler Hafr&uacute;n docked in Skagastr&ouml;nd&rsquo;s harbor. It is also the number of pages in the book.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;S&aacute; veldur sem &aacute; heldur&rdquo; is an Icelandic expression that a village resident used in conversation to describe the future of the town, in relation to its once-rich sea resources. It roughly translates to &ldquo;the one who holds it is the one who is responsible.&rdquo; I adopted the expression to refer to the book form itself, in the hands of the reader.</p>

        <p> The work was created using a score of 39 &ldquo;movements&rdquo; that were arranged by chance operations. The sections move in and out of each other, sometimes overlapping or merging. <em>530</em> was printed by Svansprent in Reykjav&iacute;k, in an edition of 50. Most of the books were given away in a series of book encounters in the town during my ﬁnal week in residency. Copies of <em>530</em> are in the artists&rsquo; books collections at Reykjav&iacute;k Art Museum, the library of Nylo (Living Art Museum, Reykjav&iacute;k), the Skagastr&ouml;nd Public Library, and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p>
