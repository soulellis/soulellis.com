        <p>Queer.Archive.Work (QAW) is a queer and trans community space and library of zines, books, and objects, collectively operated by its dedicated membership on occupied Narragansett land, in Providence, RI. We host events, produce collective publications, print propaganda, and offer access to risograph, screen printing, and bookbinding equipment.</p>

        <p>What began as a publishing project within my own practice transformed into a 501c3 non-profit in March 2020; since then the project has grown rapidly from supporting 10 artists in its first year to becoming a much-needed community hub for queer and trans life in Providence. After merging with Binch Press in 2021, we now serve 40 volunteer members who share our 2,200 square-foot studio, collectively caring for a large array of print production resources, including risograph, screenprinting, letterpress, digital printing, and binding equipment. We are mainly funded through membership contributions, grants, and public support. All aspects of the studio are managed collaboratively, from community support to equipment maintenance to fundraising to organizing around social justice movements.</p>
