        <h1>On the power of mutual aid publishing during crisis (2020)</h1>

        <p><i>The Creative Independent</i> published a version of my Urgentcraft text in June 2020, at the height of the initial COVID-19 pandemic. This version includes a very direct call to action:</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re faced with a kind of doom right now that sometimes feels like the end of the story. So here&rsquo;s what you can do, in your own work, whether it be art, design, or otherwise: Use what you have, whatever is right in front of you. Don&rsquo;t wait for the next wave of crisis. Fortify your networks now, so that when another flashpoint happens you&rsquo;re prepared to connect, to call, and to respond, to gather, and to be in it together, whatever that means to you. Map your needs. Map your assets. What are your resources? How will you share your abundance? Be generous in how, what, and with whom you share, because in these moments of exchange, communities form. Use the urgentcraft principles, re-shape them, add to them, share them. If nothing else, keep them around, as a reminder that art and design can be used to loosen power.&rdquo;</blockquote>
