			Launching at Printed Matter&rsquo;s <a href="http://nyartbookfair.com/about/" target="_blank">NY Art Book Fair</a>, <em>Printed Web 6</em> (<a href="https://queer.archive.work" target="_blank">queer.archive.work</a>) is the &filig;nal issue of <em>Printed Web</em>, a series edited and published by Paul Soulellis since 2013. It&rsquo;s an urgent act of publishing that closes out one archive to begin a new oneâ€”queer, radical, and as yet, unnamed. It&rsquo;s an assembling of queer methodologies, with a particular view towards network culture, failure, and refutation. For David Senior&rsquo;s Classroom, Paul Soulellis will be joined by several PW6 contributors for performative readings and a discussion of queer publishing. Contributors: American Artist, Somnath Bhatt, Jeffrey Cheung and Gabriel Ramirez (Unity Press), Demian Din&eacute;Yazhi&acute;, Jack Halberstam, Shawn&eacute; Michaelain Holloway, Nora Khan, Nicole Killian, Be Oakley (Genderfail Archive), Porpentine Charity Heartscape, Nate Pyper, and Sal Randolph.
