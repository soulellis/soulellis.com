Thoughts and questions from Hartman for consideration (<a href="https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/298/4088" target="_blank">audio of Hartman speaking about &ldquo;Venus In Two Acts&rdquo;</a>)—
  <br>

&ldquo;One of the things that I was really struggling with thinking through in &lsquo;Venus In Two Acts&rsquo; was the violence of the archive and the way power is registered through absences and silences, the obliteration of lives, all the things that we could not know. 
  <br>
  <br>
I wanted to topple the hierarchies that determine how we know things and who people are in the world and so I was thinking about the relationship between history and the violence of the archive as well as its fiction and its elasticity. 
<br>
  <br>
For me, what&rsquo;s really enabling about artistic practice is the way poets and filmmakers and visual artists use materials, the way beauty as both a practice and a method might enable some kind of redress, right? That might be a possible antidote to the violence that is a part of the everyday. 
  <br>
  <br>
At the same time, beauty as a discourse and a set of values is so structured by a very colonial, racist history and archival violence. So how do you steal something from it that&rsquo;s enabling, but not be caught up in its structure of value?
  <br>
  <br>
I think that artistic practice becomes the exercise of imagining beauty and what it might make possible in the world.&rdquo;

<u>Lesbian Issues</u>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, a number of social movements began to organize, such as the Women&rsquo;s Rights Movement and the Gay Liberation movement. The Women&rsquo;s Rights movement aims to achieve freedoms and entitlements for women and girls, along with equal rights for women and men. Gay Liberation and other lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) social movements aim for the social acceptance of sexual and gender minorities, and for gays
and lesbians to come out to their families and friends and participate in gay pride activities.
</p>
<p>
Rita Mae Brown (born November 28, 1944) is an American writer and political activist in the American Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement, the Gay Liberation movement, and the feminist movement. She is the bestselling author of a number of novels, most famously Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), and has also written autobiographies, a cookbook, and screenplays.

<u>AIDS Collection</u>
</p>
<p>

The AIDS Collection, 1985-1990, contains flyers, news clippings, medical studies, and guidelines, which document the work of and issues confronting AIDS organizations in Arkansas and Texas, specifically the Austin Lesbian Gay Political Caucus, AIDS Services of Austin, Austin AIDS Project, Washington County AIDS Task Force, Inc., Arkansas AIDS Foundation, and AIDS Resources Center. The flyers discuss events and marches, fundraising, and awareness, and periodicals concern education, outreach, and organizations. News stories relate to public policies, events, and homophobic acts, while medical studies describe the disease, infection rates, and fatality rates. Printed guidelines provide strategies for discussion of HIV/AIDS in schools and at home. Furthermore, the collection addresses counseling and outreach efforts of the AIDS organizations.
</p>
<p>
<br>

<u>Juanita J. Craft</u>
</p>
<p>

Juanita Craft (1902-1985) is known for her lifelong work in support of education, civil rights, and the NAACP. Born Juanita Jewel Shanks in Round Rock, Texas, on February 9, 1902, she grew up in Austin. She attended Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College where she earned a certificate in dressmaking and millinery in 1921. She arrived in Dallas in 1925 and worked as a bellmaid at the Adolphus Hotel. In 1935 she joined the NAACP and became increasingly involved in its civil rights activities. On October 2, 1937, she married Johnny Edward Craft, a union that lasted until his death on January 17, 1950. They had no children. During World War II, Craft was appointed Dallas NAACP membership chairman and, in 1946, became Texas field organizer and Dallas Youth Advisor. 

<p>
In addition, Juanita Craft served in the Dallas Democratic party for twenty-three years as precinct chairman. She was the first Black woman deputized to sell poll tax certificates in Texas. She supported herself by means of a millinery shop in her home while working with the Dallas Youth Council. Through nonviolent demonstration, the Youth Council helped to successfully challenge segregation in restaurants, lunch counters, and theaters, at North Texas State University, and at the Texas State Fair. Other programs included the "Back to School" drive in the early 1960s, the Kids Kan Kampaign neighborhood cleanup in 1965, and annual NAACP convention trips in which she accompanied teenagers. 
</p>
<p>
Craft received Dallas&rsquo; highest civic honor, the Linz Award, in 1967 for investigating, exposing, and legislating against fraudulent trade schools which had cheated many unsuspecting young people in Texas. In 1975, at the age of seventy-two, Juanita Craft won a seat on the Dallas City Council for District 6 and was re-elected in 1977. Many civic and political honors have been bestowed upon her and three times she was summoned to the White House to receive awards. The Juanita Jewel Craft Recreation Center and Park, constructed and opened in 1974 in the heart of Dallas, stands as a living testament to her lifelong work for Dallas youth and residents.

<u>The Crisis</u>
</p>
<p>

The Crisis is the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was founded in 1910 by W. E. B. Du Bois (editor), Oswald Garrison Villard, J. Max Barber, Charles Edward Russell, Kelly Miller, William Stanley Braithwaite, and Mary Dunlop Maclean. The Crisis has been in continuous print since 1910, and it is the oldest Black-oriented magazine in the world. Today, The Crisis is &ldquo;a quarterly journal of civil rights, history, politics and culture and seeks to educate and challenge its readers about issues that continue to plague African Americans and other communities of color.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<br>

<u>Moonstorm</u>
</p>
<p>

The Lesbian Alliance of St. Louis was a non-profit organization founded in 1972 by Laura Ann Moore, a civil rights and community activist, dedicated to promoting Feminist-Lesbian rights and creating a community for all women. Although the majority of the group&rsquo;s members identified as Lesbian, non-Lesbian women also comprised its membership. The Lesbian Alliance held meetings (monthly and sometimes weekly) in the Women&rsquo;s Coffeehouse, which the group founded in 1974 in A Women&rsquo;s Place. A Women&rsquo;s Place was a women&rsquo;s center operated by and for all women, but primarily Lesbian-Feminists located in St. Louis, Missouri, at the corner of Miami and Louisiana Streets. Alongside the Women&rsquo;s Coffeehouse, the center also housed a library-lounge area, recreation room, support groups for women in transition, and a legal office for research and assistance. The Lesbian Alliance of St. Louis organized meetings that included study groups on various women&rsquo;s topics, such as Feminism and Lesbianism, a variety of workshops focused on women and their lives, entertainment including women-oriented films, and discussions with other St. Louis women&rsquo;s groups. The Coffeehouse was the primary meeting location of the Lesbian Alliance until January 30, 1975, when an arsonist firebombed the building. Afterwards, the group continued to meet in various St. Louis community spaces.
</p>
<p>

The Lesbian Alliance published a semi-regular magazine and newsletter called Moonstorm. The name of this publication came from the Moon&rsquo;s historical connection to womanhood and femininity, as well as its connections to darkness and evil from the patriarchal perspective. The Lesbian Alliance of St. Louis named the publication Moonstorm to reclaim the feminine connections to the moon and to reject the patriarchal views of women and Lesbians in their current society. Moonstorm included, but was not limited to, articles covering current events, politics, social activities, philosophy, and personal stories. The Lesbian Alliance of St. Louis disbanded sometime in the late 1970s, while Moonstorm continued to publish up until the early 1980s.
</p>
<p>
<br>

<u>Amazon Quarterly</u>
</p>
<p>

As compiled by Tirza True Latimer, the roster of Amazon Quarterly contributors included Rita Mae Brown, who published excerpts of her pathbreaking lesbian novel Ruby Fruit Jungle in the magazine prior to its publication by Daughters, Inc.; Judy Grahn, who first published her epic poem &ldquo;A Woman is Talking to Death&rdquo; in Amazon Quarterly; June Arnold, who introduced her classic The Cook and the Carpenter in the magazine; along with works by Elana Nachman (later Dykewomon), Jane Rule, Alix Dobkin, Adrienne Rich, and Audre Lorde, who was poetry editor for the final four issues of the magazine&rsquo;s run.
</p>
<p>

In addition to these luminaries of feminist writing, Amazon Quarterly published work by visual artists and photographers, a commitment to aesthetics also reflected by its stylish layout. The editors expanded the magazine beyond the traditional scope of an arts journal, committing a double issue to documenting the lives of its readership around the country, traveling to several dozen locales to interview individual readers. The wide range of work Amazon Quarterly published made it a major force in the project of cohering a lesbian-feminist public that transcended a particular genre or sphere of cultural production.
</p>
<p>

Amazon Quarterly is also notable for its explicit political commitment to the proliferation of an alternative lesbian-feminist print culture and audience by fortifying the networks and circuits of lesbian cultural production. Pre-figuring the DIY ethos of riot grrl feminism, the magazine published guides for printing one&rsquo;s own magazine along with expansive listings of lesbian organizations and publications, refused to run ads, and operated on a shoestring budget that relied on volunteer labor from its audience.
</p>
<p>
<br>

<u>The Texas Human Rights Foundation</u>
</p>
<p>

The Texas Human Rights Foundation, Inc. (THRF), formerly known as the Houston Human Rights Defense Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit foundation established on June 6, 1978. THRF&rsquo;s purpose is to end discrimination based on sexual orientation or HIV status through litigation, education, and legal assistance. THRF sponsors and supports litigation, publishes booklets and newsletters, and holds events that inform Texans of their legal rights. THRF also has hotlines and an attorney referral program in order to inform and supply legal counsel to those in need.
