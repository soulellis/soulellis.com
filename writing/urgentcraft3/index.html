			We&rsquo;re more than half a year into the pandemic and I&rsquo;ve finally stopped counting my days in quarantine. Mostly because my own personal experience in isolation and whatever adjustments I&rsquo;ve had to make are not accurate representations of our collective crisis, nor does my experience portray the kind of damage being done right now by the <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">absence of leadership and the necropolitics of our time</span>. But also because it&rsquo;s not just one crisis now, nor was it ever. And it can&rsquo;t be defined along any one vector, or with any one person&rsquo;s quick take or unique perspective.

			I will talk about how I&rsquo;ve been working, and what I&rsquo;ve been doing in 2020, but first I&rsquo;ll approach that work through some of the values that I&rsquo;m prioritizing right now, as an artist-publisher, as an educator, as someone who is trying to support the radical work that I see happening around me. It&rsquo;s these values, first and foremost, that I want to share today. It&rsquo;s these values that are pivoting my own practice, and pushing my own work forward, and so I hope this might be useful for you, too.

<h3>
			Recently, I was able to tune into <a href="https://youtu.be/zqWMejD_XU8" target="_blank">a talk</a> by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, who were discussing their new text <a href="https://www.are.na/block/7951400" target="_blank">&ldquo;the university: last words,&rdquo;</a> which is in part a response to their classic work <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a17nzqutc1rgsue/undercommons_seven_theses.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">&ldquo;The University and the Undercommons&rdquo;</a> (2004). A lot was covered in this discussion, but the phrase I keep thinking about is <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid"><em>shared practice</em></span>. Towards the beginning, Dr. Moten speaks about <em>the beauty of shared practice over individual roles</em>. About how &ldquo;something problematic happens when an organization ossifies into the figure of the organizer,&rdquo; the individual, the exceptional person or committee or institution most equipped to take on the role of leadership, especially during crisis, while those who struggle the most remain outside, or below, within what they would term the space of the <em>undercommons</em>.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
			I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot, <em>the beauty of shared practice</em>. And what it might mean specifically in the context of an art and design school, where we&rsquo;ve been taught, and where we currently teach, at least <a href="http://risd.gd/" target="_blank">where I teach</a>, about the transformative power of individual expression. The power of the artist or the designer <em>as author</em>, and the values that naturally go along with this successful figure: <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">ambition, competition, profit, ownership, self-sufficiency, and domination</span>. We have no choice but to teach these values because they&rsquo;re deeply embedded within the imperial institutions that keep alive the promise of professional success, a promise that&rsquo;s designed to drive everyone towards the same goal: the credential. A degree, be it a BFA or an MFA or a PhD, and the power that degree gives not just to participate in capitalism <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid"><em>but to accelerate within it and reproduce its violence</span>.</em> In our teaching, we prioritize this value of <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">exceptionalism</span> because it&rsquo;s required by the extractive practices of the art and design worlds, disciplines that exist by feeding off of the debt produced by these schools. Ultimately, students learn that to be successful is to be sovereign&mdash;a supreme, independent power without any need to depend upon anyone or anything, be it kin or community or state, unless it&rsquo;s for profit.

	<h3>
			Instead, what might it looks like to teach, as Dr. Moten put it during the talk, &ldquo;the shared practice of fulfilling needs together as a kind of wealth&mdash;distinguishing and cultivating the wealth of our needs, rather than imagining that it&rsquo;s possible to eliminate them.&rdquo; This resonates deeply with me right now, and it challenges me to pivot my own practice: towards collective work, radical un-learning, the redistribution of resources, and communal care. <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">From <em>my work</em> ---->>> to <em>our work.</em></span>

			When I look at so many urgent artifacts produced this year in crisis, the more powerful ones operate in this realm of shared practice. These are artifacts that step away from individual authorship, towards something larger&mdash;<span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">collective, cooperative works emerging from the shared wealth of needs.</span>

<br>
	<h3>
			And I think about David Wojnarowicz&rsquo;s jacket here, worn by him at an ACT UP demonstration 32 years ago, during a different pandemic. It&rsquo;s certainly an individual expression, but I see it first as an act of protest, speaking within and on behalf of the collective, and then as a gesture of publishing, manifesting an urgent message in public space, using the very body that is the subject of that message, the body that will die of the disease, as the platform for its dissemination. This jacket is so many things. It&rsquo;s art, it&rsquo;s graphic design, it&rsquo;s a shared plea, it&rsquo;s a protest at a very particular moment. It&rsquo;s an <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid"><em>urgent artifact.</em></span>

			Here are some possible definitions of an urgent artifact: first-hand experience, given form and shared in order to expose collective struggle. A record of the moment, as evidence of crisis. Almost always containing a call-to-action: an instruction or invitation to engage, to provide aid, to push back, to refuse, to resist.

			Urgent artifacts are meaningless without distribution, publics, and circulation, which means that <em><span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">to talk of urgent artifacts is to talk about publishing:</span></em> spreading information, circulating demands, or simply expressing the moment in public despite structural failure.

			I decided to transform Queer.Archive.Work into a non-profit organization, and it lives here on the west side of Providence, RI. It&rsquo;s a physical space with <a href="https://queer.archive.work/about/index.html" target="_blank">a mission</a> to support artists and writers through queer publishing.

			It&rsquo;s an anti-racist community reading room, with <a href="http://queer.archive.work/library" target="_blank">a small library</a> of experimental publishing; it&rsquo;s a publishing studio, with <a href="https://queer.archive.work/riso/" target="_blank">a risograph machine</a> and inks and papers and binding equipment; and it&rsquo;s a project space. And it&rsquo;s also a 501(c)(3) bank account, where we raise funds from grants and individual donations to redistribute to artists in need.

			We just launched our first-ever <a href="https://queer.archive.work/residency/index.html" target="_blank">artists&rsquo; residency program</a>, with 10 artists joining us over the next year, each occupying the studio and taking over to produce their own work. The residency comes with funding, materials, and supplies, and a key to the space. Here are the first three residents: <a href="https://cierramichelepeters.com/" target="_blank">Cierra Michele Peters</a>, <a href="https://sloanleo.com/" target="_blank">Sloan Leo</a>, and <a href="https://www.ruinkraft.co/" target="_blank">&Ccedil;aca Yvaire</a>.

			For me, this is what shared practice looks like right now: <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">porous space as platform, providing access to tools that empower to realize work in new ways.</span> <em>Our work</em> right now is to make this platform safe, accessible, and anti-racist, operating outside of, and counter to, legacy institutions like commercial galleries, museums, and art and design schools.

			These are spaces and practices that refuse to replicate or support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_domination" target="_blank">matrix of domination</a> (heteronormativity, white supremacy, settler colonialism, and capitalism). These agitators don&rsquo;t wait for a crisis to peak: their work is slow and persistent, prioritizing communal care as an urgent, never-ending practice.

			We&rsquo;re faced with a kind of doom right now that sometimes feels like the end of the story. So here&rsquo;s what we can do. In our own work, whether it be art, design, or otherwise: <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">use what we have</span>, whatever is right in front of us. <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">Don&rsquo;t wait for the next wave of crisis</span>. <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">Strengthen our networks now</span>, so that when another flash point happens we&rsquo;re prepared to connect, to call, and to respond, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VevVQ9xeUNc" target="_blank">to gather, and to be in it together,</a> whatever that means to you. <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">Map our needs</span>. <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">Map our assets</span>. What are our resources? How will we share our abundance? <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">Be generous in how, what, and with whom we share</span>, because in these moments of exchange, communities form. <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">Use the urgentcraft principles</span>, re-shape them, add to them, share them. If nothing else, keep them around, as a reminder <span style="background-color: black; color: darkorchid">that art and design can be used to loosen power.</span>
