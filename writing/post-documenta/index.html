			Publishing is political. Publishing can compel, persuade, inform, attract, confuse, script, or manipulate. Urgent acts of &ldquo;making public&rdquo; can mobilize communities and inspire change in real time. In crisis, we see independent artists, community organizers, scholars, and activists collectively engaging with sophisticated modes of publishing to record and communicate in real time, while those in traditional positions of power use those same tools to engineer and control our defining narratives. It&rsquo;s here that we can locate the enormous paradox of contemporary publishing: its potential to <em>oppress</em> as well as to <em>empower</em>.
				<br>
				<br>
			From Facebook posts to presidential tweets, from dance-based memes to print-on-demand journals to mutual aid zines, stories are constructed and experiences shared across networks. How and why they reach us and why we&rsquo;re compelled to trust them&mdash;or not&mdash;is crucial to any understanding of how publishing operates right now. 
				<br>
				<br>
			Publics consume and amplify, and sometimes resist and refuse, those defining narratives.
				<br>
				<br>
			This syllabus focuses in particular on those queer strategies of resistance, refusal, and survival. As an overarching idea, <em>urgentcraft</em> explores the potential for radical publishing to gather and mobilize people around urgent artifacts and messages. As a syllabus, <em>urgentcraft</em> presents a range of artists, projects, texts, and concepts that foreground those strategies in recent history, as well as in contemporary independent publishing. As an expanding set of principles, <em>urgentcraft</em> identifies anti-racist ways of working in crisis, using art and design to fuel emancipatory projects and the movement towards liberation.

    	<img src="12.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		    Publishing is more than making a book. Publishing is more than the artistic, commercial, and academic worlds that are commonly known as the publishing &ldquo;industry.&rdquo; 
				<br>
				<br>
		    Today, publishing is personal and everyday. It&rsquo;s the intimacy of direct communication over networks. It&rsquo;s the fundamental act of <em>making public</em>. 
		</p>

		<img src="4.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
			<h3>Community bulletin board, Taiwan</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
			I come back to the community bulletin board again and again as a basic and banal example of making public in physical space. Is this publishing? I propose that it is: selecting something to amplify, and posting that information in public to give it an audience.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
			What about this? Is this publishing? It&rsquo;s certainly <em>making public</em>, but less about posting something and more about performing for a very specific audience. It brings up the idea of addressivity. In this notion of &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; everyone isn&rsquo;t included&mdash;only those who have gathered in time and space to listen. This image asks us to look closely at what is meant by &ldquo;public.&rdquo; When we speak, who&rsquo;s listening?

			These newer forms of making public that are more temporal, durational, or ephemeral are important to examine now in the context of contemporary publishing. I love stretching the idea of publishing into these slippery spaces.

			These are forms that are super familiar to us now. Platforms that have become places for us to publish on a daily basis, cultivating vast audiences with direct engagement.
		</p>

				<img src="14.jpg" style="max-width: 95%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		For the artist publisher, an ordinary table at an art book fair is another kind of platform, allowing the artist to be on one side and their public on the other. Direct engagement over the published material, in physical space.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">2<br>GESTURES OF PUBLISHING</h2>

				<img src="15.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		I&rsquo;m borrowing these ideas from social theorist Michael Warner, who wrote about publics in his text “Publics and Counterpublics.” I come back to this dense reading again and again. When I discuss it with students I usually re-read it, and to try to get a little bit further with it each time.
		</p>

				<img src="16.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		In this text Warner makes distinctions between the public, or &ldquo;everyone out there,&rdquo; and a very specific public&mdash;say, those particular people who have intentionally gathered around to listen. In &ldquo;Publics and Counterpublics&rdquo; Warner gives us the concept of multiple publics.
		</p>

				<img src="17.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Warner says that to publish is not just to &ldquo;make public,&rdquo; but to form &ldquo;<u>a</u> public&rdquo; through discourse&mdash;&ldquo;the kind of public that comes into being only in relation to texts and their circulation.&rdquo; A public gathers around the work as it travels, as it&rsquo;s referenced and cited, and as it&rsquo;s discussed. Only then has a public formed.
		</p>

				<img src="18.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Previously, we may have thought about publishing as the production of objects: things that one makes, like books, zines, and digital files.
		</p>

				<img src="20.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But through Warner&rsquo;s framework, publishing is less about the objects you make, and more about the actions you take. Your publics form around these actions, through the dispersion of material. Seth Price writes about this in &ldquo;<a href="http://www.distributedhistory.com/Dispersion2007.comp.pdf" target="_blank">Dispersion</a>.&rdquo; As an act of &ldquo;<a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/dispersion" target="_blank">distribution, rather than production</a>,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s easy to consider artistic publishing in these terms, as a gesture or performance.
		</p>

				<img src="21.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		This is why acts of performative publishing like live streaming or posting are intriguing: the act of accessing the work is an engagement with the gesture of publishing itself. In <em>The Download,</em> a series of commissioned works for Rhizome, artists created digital works of net art solely intended for download, contained entirely within ZIP files.
		</p>

				<img src="23.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		In <em>The Download</em>, the act of publishing is located within the uploading and downloading of the files, the private performance of these files on a viewer&rsquo;s desktop, and the circulation of those files on the network. Evidence of gestural acts and movements is contained in the language of the project itself: zipping, uploading, downloading, unzipping, expanding, etc.
		</p>

				<img src="24.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		There&rsquo;s an entire world of net art that approaches publishing in this way, in the realm of digital files that circulate from server to server, device to device. Rhizome&rsquo;s <em>Net Art Anthology</em> indexes the history of net art, and is a valuable resource for understanding how artists have worked on digital networks during the last forty years.   
		</p>

		<img src="25.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The project is documented online and in this beautiful book. It includes &ldquo;The Post as Medium,&rdquo; which traces a history of the post as a gesture of publishing.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">3<br>POSTING</h2>


    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Posting is an essential act of publishing, perhaps the oldest. I&rsquo;m referring to the act of posting a photo or tweet, or making a blog post. But if we consider a deeper history of the word <em>post</em>, there&rsquo;s little information to be found.
		</p>

		<img src="26.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We can try to trace a history of the word <em>post</em> within other words that contain the gesture of posting, like &ldquo;poster.&rdquo; The poster is a basic form that carries within it the act of displaying its contents on a vertical surface, usually in public space. The poster&rsquo;s origins are thousands of years old, or even older, if we consider the very first marks made by humans on walls. Posting is a foundational gesture.
		</p>

		<img src="27.jpg" style="max-width: 40%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But what about English language expressions like &ldquo;keep me posted,&rdquo; or &ldquo;post office,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the daily post?&rdquo; Without sufficient scholarly research, it&rsquo;s been suggested that &ldquo;posting the news&rdquo; comes from the figure of the town crier. He would read the news out loud at the center of town, for the benefit of a probably illiterate audience. When he was finished announcing the news, he would nail the paper to a <em>door post</em> as visible evidence of it having been heard, and so&mdash;the news was posted.
		</p>

		<img src="28.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		There&rsquo;s a rich history of artists who use this very basic gesture of posting in public space in order to announce something or give access to information, and directly engage with a more expanded audience. From Jenny Holzer&rsquo;s <em>Truisms</em> in the 1970s,

		and Zoe Leonard&rsquo;s publishing of the statement &ldquo;I want a dyke for president&rdquo; early in the 1990s in support of the poet Eileen Myles, who was running for US president, and then again during the 2016 US presidential election, as a gigantic poster installed on the High Line in New York City,

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">4<br>STACKING</h2>


		<img src="33.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Beyond the post, I propose a few other gestures of publishing, like stacking.
		</p>

		<img src="34.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Like posting, stacking is basic. It brings to mind one of the most common ways to distribute printed material in public space: by using gravity. If something isn&rsquo;t hanging up or posted on a wall, it&rsquo;s probably sitting flat, stacked on a horizontal surface somewhere, like at a newsstand, or a bookstore, or an art book fair. 
		</p>

		<img src="35.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		One may simply set up a table (or set down a blanket) as a way to display stacks of material in public. While posting doesn&rsquo;t always invite a reciprocal gesture, stacking is a clear invitation to take. The new project <em>Library of Study</em>, located in Brooklyn, NY, curates books around an abolitionist theme and places them on a table in a public park, inviting discussion and borrowing.
		</p>

		<img src="36.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Individual prints can be stacked on the floor, as Edson Chagas did at the Venice Biennale in 2013.
		</p>

		<img src="37.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres used the stack as a sculptural form in itself: the stack as medium.
		</p>

		<img src="38.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Felix&rsquo;s stacks are unlimited, with detailed instructions about keeping them constantly replenished. His stack works dismantle the monumentality of sculptural form; the artwork here is no longer a single, unique object, but rather an act of publishing that&rsquo;s always disappearing and re-forming itself.
		</p>

		<img src="39.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		I&rsquo;ve only found one good text on stacks: “The Ethos of the Edition,” by Susan Tallman, who writes specifically about the stacks of Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and how he resists traditional notions of power by distributing his work in unlimited editions, more akin to a publishing model rather than an art market one.

		</p>

		<img src="41.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Dropping is much less common, but we know about it from images like these, which are associated with propaganda and the state. The idea is to force an act of publishing onto a specific territory.</p>

		Dropping can also be a protest tactic, like here at the Guggenheim Museum on February 9, 2019. Protestors dropped leaflets designed to look like prescriptions, in response to the museum&rsquo;s ties to the Sackler family and the OxyContin opioid crisis.

I suspect networks like this one will eventually devolve out of use, as specific formats like USB change or disappear.

    	<p class="aquamarine">
    	One more publishing gesture is streaming, or rather: feeds and streams.
    	</p>

		<img src="52.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Individual posts are rarely encountered on their own; they accumulate into feeds. The feed is experienced as a never-ending flow of posts. I think this is one of the most significant ways to think about publishing today: the feeds we surround ourselves with, that we&rsquo;re comforted by, and that we nurture and take care of. Our current notion of feeds began with the evolution of blogs in the late 90s, but exploded in popularity after the launch of the Facebook wall feature in 2004 and the launches of Twitter in 2006, Tumblr in 2007, and Instagram in 2010. 
		</p>

		<img src="53.jpg">
		<h3>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dh_BZPxveY</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		If accumulating posts are a feed, then the non-stop feed is a stream. Streaming is now an entire economy, with performers going live on YouTube and Twitch and Tiktok and sharing in those platforms&rsquo; profits. This is fundamentally different from the 20th-century model of broadcasting; platforms are easily accessible in exchange for data, which is extracted by enormous tech corporations for prediction and profit.
		</p>

		<img src="54.jpg" style="max-width: 70%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Although the feed feels relatively new, it&rsquo;s actually been around since the 19th century. The feed is a product of the industrial revolution. I find the first references to <em>feed</em> as a flow of information in the early 1840s, around the invention of the telegraph. Photography also appears for the first time at exactly this moment. The feed continues to evolve as networked communication and information transmission advances through the 20th century (think: radio, television and the &ldquo;live feed&rdquo;).
		</p>

		<img src="55.jpg" style="max-width: 80%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But this is what our feeds are quickly evolving into today, in late-stage capitalism. The interface is dematerializing; we no longer <em>see</em> the feed visually or recognize it as an accumulation of posts. Rather, we <em>feel it</em> as an ambient presence. A device like this one is still engineered to operate as a series of inquiries and responses that are &ldquo;posted&rdquo; back and forth. But the experience is much smoother than that. It&rsquo;s no longer a bumpy interface of buttons and boxes, but of smooth, natural language.

		My own response to these questions takes the form of a demand: <em>resist the smoothness of design perfection</em>. I make this demand of myself and I ask it of students when I teach.

		In July 2020, I was able to tune into <a href="https://youtu.be/zqWMejD_XU8" target="_blank">a talk</a> by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, who discussed the beauty of <em>shared practice over individual roles</em>, and since then I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what this might mean specifically in the context of art and design schools. Those who were educated in mainstream art and design programs tend to continue to teach as they were taught, making it difficult to disrupt normative narratives around art and design. </p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		To get closer to urgentcraft, I propose that we use archives like time machines, dialing back into significant moments over the last fifty years to see how others have resisted and persisted through shared, radical acts of publishing. We can learn from those ongoing struggles for liberation and allow them to inform the way we work today.

		Participation in <em>The Black Panther Party Newspaper</em> ecosystem was supported by the act of delivering it. Panthers themselves were responsible for dispersing the news, and would sell the paper in laundromats, street corners, and other public spaces. Each distribution point was also an opportunity to learn, interact, and engage between people. The quality and urgency of the information distributed, and the open access to party members themselves, can be seen as a kind of wealth&mdash;not a wealth of accumulation, but a shared wealth of needs emerging from within a struggling community. 
		</p>

		<img src="77.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		As a shared practice, <em>The Black Panther Party Newspaper</em> was not just a published product, but an alternative publishing economy that prioritized care and community need. This was negotiated and fulfilled collectively through acts of mutual aid. The cost of the paper was 25 cents, and sellers would keep a dime from each sale. The exchange of money enabled the newspaper to continue printing, but also directly benefited those who labored in its production and distribution, as well as those who received the actual news.

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The form, a printed newspaper, was conventional&mdash;but all other aspects of the project challenged normative expectations, from its politics to its design to its method of distribution to its economic model to its public impact. It was <em>urgent publishing</em> in the timeliness of its delivery, and the necessity to engage and commune in the exact moment of exchange. This was radical publishing because it interfered with mainstream ideas about Black life and survival in the US, illustrating and amplifying the conversation around racial injustice. It gave voice to Black communities in crisis. It was radical publishing because the distribution of the newspaper created and benefited a mutual aid network of engaged participants who visibly performed labor, selling (and purchasing) the paper in open, public space, interfering with the usual channels of delivery and consumption, while working against the conventions of white-controlled, white supremacist media.

It&rsquo;s less the work of a specific artist who publishes, and more the plea for communal responsibility and care by a political subject, struggling in illness against state negligence (Wojnarowicz died of AIDS four years later).

			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Echoing Wojnarowicz, Parker Bright used their body to intentionally obscure the view of a controversial painting of Emmett Till by Dana Schutz at the 2017 Whitney Biennial. With their body in the way and the message “Black Death Spectacle” hand-written on their back, they interfered with the <em>ultimate smooth flow</em> of an undisturbed art-viewing experience. And by doing so they disturbed the visual culture of violence that white supremacy enacts through the art world and the artists it protects.  
		</p>

		<img src="91.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Blocking the view, Parker reduced the legibility of the painting in one dimension, but enhanced it in another, by giving it a new caption. And as their act was photographed and amplified, they occupied digital spaces, too&mdash;taking over the narrative and forever bonding their message with the painting in digital archives. To borrow a term from US statesman and civil rights leader John Lewis, Parker caused <em>good trouble</em> by using their own visibility to get in the way.

		<img src="86.jpg" style="max-width: 65%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Wherever there is visibility, there is privilege&mdash;the ability to use one&rsquo;s body and to have it read clearly. For many bodies this isn&rsquo;t safe. And so refusal and illegibility are also tactics for us to look at here. The act of refusal&mdash;deliberately turning away from structures that exclude and erase&mdash;remains an important form of critique, resistance, and survival under oppression.
		</p>

		<img src="89.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Many artists who work against, manipulate, or interfere with visibility today are fighting for racial, transgender, mental health, immigration, and other forms of justice.

			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		American Artist is an artist who legally changed their name in 2013 as an act of refusal and illegibility, reframing both of the words: <em>American</em> and <em>Artist</em>. In refusing to use their birth name, they manipulate legibility and how one is properly &ldquo;read&rdquo; by the state, denying and shaping perception around who gets to claim the privilege carried in these words, and foregrounding how whiteness persists in art world spaces.

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		American Artist continues to evolve an important body of work, as well as writings, using techniques of refusal and redaction to agitate the ultimate smooth flow of art world purity.

		<img src="97.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Right now, I&rsquo;m trying to bring queer strategies of resistance and survival into my own spaces, whether they be in my own practice, in teaching, or in community building.
		</p>

		<img src="94.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		In 2019, I experimented with <em>Urgency Lab</em>, a series of classes and workshops. In the past, I worked to control each of the learning outcomes when teaching. But to resist a more typical approach to pedagogy means dealing with uncertainty in the classroom. 
		</p>

				<img src="98.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
		<p class="aquamarine">
		With students at the Rhode Island School of Design, we tried to stay with the mess of not always knowing those outcomes. We explored what it feels like to step away from the institution and work outside of traditional values in higher education, like exceptionalism, competition, and perfection; we even physically left the campus. What would it mean for a classroom to be a space for communal care? Eventually we realized that the urgency was right in the room with us, in the form of our own vulnerabilities.
		</p>

		<img src="99.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		At the conclusion of the class we hesitated to produce any kind of validating object or product. But we did publish this collaborative deck of cards that foregrounds the values that emerged during the semester. <em>Urgency Cookbook</em> was written and hand-drawn by everyone in the class from a collaborative doc that we worked on for several weeks, full of ingredients and recipes for survival and communal care.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Teaching has become a way for me to focus less on personal accomplishment and power and more on an engaged pedagogy, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/stai34gcqla84m5/bell-hooks-teaching-to-transgress.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">after bell hooks</a>, that tries to empower everyone in the room, with a commitment to dialogue, shared vulnerability, and criticality.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">16<br>QUEER ARCHIVE WORK</h2>


		<img src="100.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Outside of teaching, I&rsquo;m developing a practice that prioritizes collaboration and making space for other voices. <em>Queer.Archive.Work</em> began with this question: how might a publication provide a queer space for collective care? The first three issues featured the words and images of 50 artists and writers making good trouble with their work, with a focus on LGBTQIA+ and others folks traditionally left out of or erased from archives.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		These publications were designed to make a physical mess as the components slide out of their containers. This is when I began thinking intentionally about urgentcraft in the context of my own design practice&mdash;staying with the mess to allow for an abundance of meaning, and no dominant narrative. In <em>Queer.Archive.Work</em>, most of the printed items remained un-bound, using no glue, staples, or tape. Instead, the parts were folded, nested, and enveloped to encourage new kinds of readings.		
		</p>

		<img src="101.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Our installation at Printed Matter&rsquo;s NY Art Book Fair in 2019 tried to display this deliberate non-linearity and lack of hierarchy. This was not just about the optics of making a mess, or the visual confusion of illegibility. The space was designed to discourage a quick, fixed read, and empower visitors to do the work of shaping the material themselves.
		</p>

		<img src="102.jpg" style="max-width: 85%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Through <em>Queer.Archive.Work</em>, I also published two issues of <em>Urgency Reader</em>. 
		</p>	

		<img src="103.jpg" style="max-width: 85%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The second issue was made at the start of the COVID pandemic, just as the US was shutting down in March 2020. I posted an open call, and 110 contributors submitted work reflecting observations and impressions during quarantine. Everything was risograph printed.
		</p>

		<img src="104.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		It was also a mutual aid project, using grant funding to distribute money to all of the contributors, who either accepted the compensation or donated it back to the pool.
		</p>

		<img src="105.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Recently, I decided to transform <em>Queer.Archive.Work</em> from a publishing practice into a non-profit community space, and besides teaching, this is where all of my energy goes now. I&rsquo;m interested in how a physical space can be porous, how open access to tools can be a form of community empowerment&mdash;in this case a shared risograph printer in a publishing studio. This is about bringing engaged pedagogy out of the school and into a more open and diverse community, away from larger institutions.
		</p>

		<img src="106.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
	   	<p class="aquamarine">
		Queer.Archive.Work is now a community publishing space, both physically and online. QAW is always free and open to anyone, prioritizing queer and trans, Black, Indigenous, artists and writers of color, and others who don&rsquo;t necessarily have easy access to traditional art world spaces.
		</p>

		<img src="107.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
		<p class="aquamarine">
		Artists-in-residence and visitors to QAW can use a growing library of zines, books, and unusual examples of experimental publishing for inspiration and research.		
		</p>

		<img src="108.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
		<p class="aquamarine">
		The <em>Download Library</em> is our own time machine of independent publishing through history, focused mostly on urgency, radical thinking, and liberation in the last fifty years. 
		</p>

		<img src="109.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
		<p class="aquamarine">
		QAW brings direct financial and creative support to artists through a risograph residency program. In 2020 we began hosting residents, both locally and from throughout the US. Each artist is granted the entire studio for their own use during a 2-week residency, along with supplies and cash funding to support their work.

		<img src="112.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		As a growing community, Queer.Archive.Work is learning about what it means to gather during distanced times, and how to create and sustain a genuine sense of connection on Slack and Instagram and Zoom. Too often, urgency is used to exert pressure and power over a situation, on platforms like these and within institutions that use speed and highly visible results as a form of gatekeeping, and as ways to inhibit thoughtful decision-making. We&rsquo;re looking closely at how we use <em>urgency</em> as a particular concept in our collective publishing spaces&mdash;

		<img src="115.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		After the incredible mess of 2020, I&rsquo;m finding it helpful to circulate queer strategies of resistance and survival as a loose set of principles, within forms like talks and writing and this syllabus. Urgentcraft is about dismantling oppression-based ideologies and prioritizing anti-racism, justice, and liberation in our work. It&rsquo;s about recognizing urgent artifacts as necessary acts of making public that gather and mobilize people around radical potential. Urgentcraft exists outside of art and design worlds, outside of brilliance, perfect legibility, otherworldly craft, extractive practices, and profit at all costs. Urgentcraft interrupts the ultimate smooth flow of design perfection and art world purity. It is not an aesthetic.

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We&rsquo;re faced with a kind of doom right now that sometimes feels like the end of the story. This is my own call to action, shared here in response to this sense of finality. 
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		In our own work, whether it be art, design, or otherwise: use what we have, whatever is right in front of us. Don&rsquo;t wait for the next wave of crisis. Strengthen our networks now, so that when another flash point happens we&rsquo;re prepared to connect, to call, and to respond, to gather, and to be in it together, whatever that means to us. Map our needs. Map our assets. What are our resources? How will we share our abundance? Be generous in how, what, and with whom we share, because in these moments of exchange, communities form. Use the urgentcraft principles, re-shape them, add to them, share them. If nothing else, keep them around, as a reminder that art and design can be used to loosen power.
