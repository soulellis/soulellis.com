			Publishing is political. Publishing can compel, persuade, inform, attract, confuse, script, or manipulate. Urgent acts of &ldquo;making public&rdquo; can mobilize communities and inspire change in real time. In crisis, we see independent artists, community organizers, scholars, and activists collectively engaging with sophisticated modes of publishing to record and communicate in real time, while those in traditional positions of power use those same tools to engineer and control our defining narratives. It&rsquo;s here that we can locate the enormous paradox of contemporary publishing: its potential <em>to oppress</em> as well as <em>to empower</em>.
				<br>
				<br>
			From Facebook posts to presidential tweets, from dance-based memes to print-on-demand journals to mutual aid zines, stories are constructed and experiences shared across networks. How and why they reach us and why we&rsquo;re compelled to trust them&mdash;or not&mdash;is crucial to any understanding of how publishing operates right now. 
				<br>
				<br>
			Publics consume and amplify, and sometimes resist and refuse, those defining narratives.
				<br>
				<br>
			This syllabus focuses in particular on those queer strategies of resistance and survival. As an overarching idea, <em>urgentcraft</em> explores the potential for radical publishing to gather and mobilize people around urgent artifacts and messages. As a syllabus, <em>urgentcraft</em> presents a range of artists, projects, texts, and concepts that foreground those strategies in recent history, as well as in contemporary independent publishing. As an expanding set of principles, <em>urgentcraft</em> identifies anti-racist ways of working in crisis, using art and design to fuel emancipatory projects and the movement towards liberation.

    	<img src="12.jpg">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		    Publishing is more than making a book. Publishing is more than the artistic, commercial, and academic worlds that are commonly known as the publishing &ldquo;industry.&rdquo; 
				<br>
				<br>
		    Today, publishing is personal and everyday. It&rsquo;s the intimacy of communication over networks. It&rsquo;s the fundamental act of <em>making public</em>. 
		</p>

		<img src="4.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
			<h3>Community bulletin board, Taiwan</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
			I come back to this image of a community bulletin board again and again as a basic and banal example of making public. Is this publishing? I propose that it is&mdash;selecting something to amplify, and posting that information in public to give it an audience.
		</p>

		<img src="7.jpg">
			<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Savio" target="_blank">Mario Savio</a>, leader of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, speaks to assembled students on the campus at the University of California, Berkeley, on Dec. 7, 1964 (Robert W. Klein/AP)</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
			What about this? Is this publishing? It&rsquo;s certainly <em>making public</em>, but less about posting something and more about performing for a very specific audience. It brings up the idea of addressivity. In this notion of &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; everyone isn&rsquo;t included&mdash;only those who have gathered in time and space to listen. This image asks me to look closely at what I mean by public. When we speak, who&rsquo;s listening?

    	<p class="aquamarine">
			Is this jacket an act of publishing? More on the jacket below. This kind of making public interests me deeply.

    	<p class="aquamarine">
			As do these newer forms of making public that are temporal, sometimes durational, and almost always ephemeral. I love stretching the idea of publishing into these slippery places.

			These are forms that are super familiar to us now. Platforms that have become places for us to publish on a daily basis, with access to and direct engagement with vast audiences.

		For the artist publisher, an ordinary table at an art book fair is another platform, allowing them to be on one side and their public on the other. Direct engagement over the published material, in physical space.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">2<br>GESTURES OF PUBLISHING</h2>

				<img src="15.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		I&rsquo;m borrowing these ideas from social theorist Michael Warner, who wrote about publics in his text “Publics and Counterpublics.” I come back to this dense reading again and again. When I teach it I usually re-read it with students to try to get a little bit further with it each time.
		</p>

				<img src="16.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		In this text Warner makes distinctions between the public, or “everyone out there,” and a very specific public&mdash;say, those particular people who have gathered intentionally around something. In &ldquo;Publics and Counterpublics&rdquo; Warner gives us the concept of a plurality of publics. Multiple publics.
		</p>

				<img src="17.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Warner says that to publish is not just to &ldquo;make public,&rdquo; but to make <u>a</u> public through the circulation of material. A public gathers around the work as it circulates and generates discourse, and only then has a public formed.
		</p>

				<img src="18.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Previously, we may have thought about publishing as the production of objects: things that one makes, like books, zines, and digital files.
		</p>

				<img src="20.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Warner turns this around. He writes that publishing is less about the objects you make, and more about the actions you take. Your publics form around these actions, through the dispersion of material. Seth Price <a href="http://www.distributedhistory.com/Dispersion2007.comp.pdf" target="_blank">writes about this too</a>. As an act of &ldquo;<a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/dispersion" target="_blank">distribution, rather than production</a>,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s easy to consider artistic publishing in gestural terms, or as a performance.
		</p>

				<img src="21.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		This is why I&rsquo;m so intrigued by acts of performative publishing like live streaming, or posting digital files that are meant to be downloaded. In <em>The Download,</em> a series of commissioned works for Rhizome, artists created works contained entirely within ZIP files.
		</p>

				<img src="23.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The act of publishing can be located right there in the uploading and downloading of the files, the private performance of these files on a viewer&rsquo;s desktop, and the circulation of these files on the network. It&rsquo;s all about movement.
		</p>

				<img src="24.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		There&rsquo;s an entire world of net art that approaches publishing in this way, in the realm of digital files that circulate from server to server, device to device. Rhizome&rsquo;s <em>Net Art Anthology</em> indexes the history of net art, and is an invaluable resource for understanding how artists have located their work on digital networks during the last forty years.   
		</p>

		<img src="25.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The project is documented online and in this beautiful book. It includes &ldquo;The Post as Medium,&rdquo; which traces a history of the post as a gesture of publishing. 
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Posting is an essential act of publishing, perhaps its oldest. By act I mean posting a photo or tweet, or making a blog post. If we consider a deeper history of the word <em>post</em>, there&rsquo;s little information to be found.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">3<br>POSTING</h2>


		<img src="26.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But we can try to trace the word <em>post</em> back through time within other words that contain the gesture of posting, like &ldquo;poster.&rdquo; The poster is a basic form that carries within it the act of displaying its contents on a vertical surface, usually in public space. The poster&rsquo;s origins are thousands of years old, or even older, if we consider the very first marks made by humans on walls. Posting is a foundational gesture.
		</p>

		<img src="27.jpg" style="max-width: 40%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But what about language like &ldquo;keep me posted,&rdquo; or &ldquo;post office,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the daily post?&rdquo; Without much scholarly research, it&rsquo;s been suggested that &ldquo;posting the news&rdquo; comes from the figure of the town crier. He would read the news out loud at the center of town, for the benefit of a probably illiterate audience. When he was finished announcing the news, he would nail it to a <em>door post</em> as evidence of it having been heard, and so&mdash;the news was posted.
		</p>

		<img src="28.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		There is a rich history of artists who have used the very basic gesture of posting in public space in order to announce something or give access to information, and engage with a more expanded audience. From Jenny Holzer&rsquo;s <em>Truisms</em> in the 1970s,

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">4<br>STACKING</h2>


		<img src="33.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Beyond the post, I propose a few other gestures of publishing, like stacking.
		</p>

		<img src="34.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Like posting, stacking is basic. It brings to mind one of the most common ways to distribute printed material in public space: using gravity. If it&rsquo;s not hanging up or posted on a wall, it&rsquo;s probably sitting flat, stacked on a horizontal surface somewhere, like at a newsstand, or a bookstore, or an art book fair. 
		</p>

		<img src="35.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		One can simply set up a table (or set down a blanket) as a way to display stacks of material in public. While posting doesn&rsquo;t always invite a reciprocal gesture, stacking is a clear invitation to take. The new project <em>Library of Study</em>, located in Brooklyn, curates books around an abolitionist theme and places them on a table in public space, inviting discussion and borrowing.
		</p>

		<img src="36.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Individual prints can be stacked on the floor, as Edson Chagas did at the Venice Biennale in 2013.
		</p>

		<img src="37.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres used the stack as a sculptural form in itself. The stack as medium.
		</p>

		<img src="38.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Felix&rsquo;s stacks are unlimited, with detailed instructions about their constant replenishment. His stack works dismantle the monumentality of sculptural form; the sculpture here is no longer a single, unique object, but rather an act of publishing that&rsquo;s always disappearing and re-forming itself.
		</p>

		<img src="39.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		I&rsquo;ve only been able to find one good text on stacks: “The Ethos of the Edition,” by Susan Tallman, who writes specifically about the stacks of Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and how he resists traditional notions of power by distributing his work in unlimited editions, more akin to a publishing model rather than an art market one.

		<img src="40.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Dropping is another publishing gesture.
		</p>

		<img src="41.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Dropping is much less common, but we know about it from images like this one, which are really associated with propaganda and the state. The idea of forcing an act of publishing onto a territory.</p> 

		<img src="42.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		These images display dropping as an imperial tactic&mdash;the author comes from above to impose a message, dropping it onto the land.
		</p>

		
		<img src="50.jpg">
			<h3>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/arts/protesters-guggenheim-sackler.html</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Dropping is also used as a protest tactic, as seen here at the Guggenheim Museum on February 9, 2019. Protestors dropped leaflets designed to look like prescriptions, in response to the museum&rsquo;s ties to the Sackler family and the OxyContin opioid crisis.
		</p>

		<img src="43.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But dropping is also the language we use to talk about transferring digital files.
		</p>

		<img src="44.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We know dropping in a more everyday way like this: the act of publishing or sharing between devices, visualized as passing files through the air and dropping them into a specific location. As well as &ldquo;dropping an album.&rdquo; Dropping in this sense is associated with convenience and direct, immediate access. 
		</p>

		<img src="45.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Using those same terms, this is dropping, too. Books are dropped off at a specific location, to be picked up in a direct way. This kind of dropping can almost feel intimate, especially during pandemic times, because of the physical act of touching materials and placing them in boxes in residential neighborhoods.
		</p>

		<img src="47.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Anastasia Kubrak has a project that mixes together many of these ideas, where state-censored documents are printed and left at specially-marked drop points in the city of Moscow. The secret drop-off sites are identified by an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in a box.
		</p>

		<img src="48.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Aram Bartholl&rsquo;s <em>Dead Drops</em> project is a vast network of USB drives embedded in architectural surfaces, usually located (illicitly) in public space. The project really functions like an offline network for the distribution of digital material, totally independent from the internet. I suspect networks like this one will eventually devolve out of use, as technology formats change.

		<img src="52.jpg">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>
    	<p class="aquamarine">
		One more publishing gesture is streaming, or rather: feeds and streams. Individual posts are rarely encountered on their own; they accumulate into feeds. The feed is experienced as a never-ending flow of posts. I think this is one of the most important ways to think about publishing today: the feeds we surround ourselves with, that we&rsquo;re comforted by, and that we nurture and take care of. Our current notion of feeds began with the evolution of blogs in the late 90s, but exploded in popularity after the launch of the Facebook wall feature in 2004 and the launch of Twitter in 2006, Tumblr in 2007, and Instagram in 2010.

		If accumulating posts are a feed, then the non-stop feed is a stream. Streaming is now an entire economy, with streamers performing live on Youtube and Twitch and Tiktok and sharing in advertising profits. This is fundamentally different from the 20th-century model of broadcasting; platforms are easily accessible in exchange for data, which is extracted by enormous tech corporations for prediction and profit.

		Although the feed feels relatively recent, it&rsquo;s actually been around since the 19th century; it&rsquo;s a product of the industrial revolution. I find the first references to the feed as a flow of information in the early 1840s, around the invention of the telegraph. Photography also appears for the first time at exactly this moment. The feed continues to evolve as networked communication and information transmission advances throughout the 20th-century (think: radio, television and the &ldquo;live feed.&rdquo;

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		But this is what our feeds are quickly evolving into today, in late-stage capitalism. The interface is dematerializing; we no longer <em>see</em> the feed or recognize it as an accumulation of posts. Rather, we experience it and <em>feel it</em> like an ambient presence. A device like this one is still engineered to operate via a series of inquiries and responses that are &ldquo;posted&rdquo; back and forth. But the experience is much smoother than that. It&rsquo;s no longer an interface of buttons and boxes, but of smooth, natural language.

		My own response to these questions takes the form of a demand: <em>resist the smoothness of design perfection</em>. I make this demand of myself and I ask it of students when I teach. This form of resistance means always questioning. More than questioning, it also means committing to a deep examination of the less visible ideologies that lurk behind the design products that govern how we live and communicate.

		In July 2020, I was able to tune into <a href="https://youtu.be/zqWMejD_XU8" target="_blank">a talk</a> by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, who discussed the beauty of <em>shared practice over individual roles</em>, and I’ve been thinking about what this might mean specifically in the context of art and design schools. Those who were educated in mainstream design programs tend to continue to teach as they were taught, making it difficult to disrupt normative narratives around art and design. </p>

		The institutions that pay us to teach today are built upon traditional neo-liberal values that prioritize individual expression and independence as transformative powers. We&rsquo;re encouraged to teach the values that naturally go along with the successful figure of the artist or designer as author: ambition, competition, perfection, profit, ownership, self-sufficiency, and domination.

		It sometimes feels like we have no choice but to teach these values because of how deeply they&rsquo;re embedded within legacy art and design institutions. These values perpetuate the promise of professional success&mdash;an expectation that depends upon everyone driving towards the same goal of <em>the credential</em>. The credential is a degree, be it a BFA or an MFA or a PhD, and the privilege and power granted by that degree: not only to participate in capitalism, but to accelerate within it and reproduce its violence.

		In our teaching, we prioritize <em>exceptionalism</em> as the most important value inherent in the student&rsquo;s education, because the extractive practices of the art and design worlds require it.

		To get closer to urgentcraft, I propose that we use archives like time machines, dialing back into historical moments over the last fifty years to see how others have resisted and persisted through shared, radical acts of publishing. We can learn from those ongoing struggles for liberation and allow them to inform the way we work today, in crisis.

		Participation in <em>The Black Panther Party Newspaper</em> ecosystem was supported by the act of delivering it. Black Panther Party members themselves were responsible for dispersing the news, and would sell the paper in laundromats, street corners, and other public spaces. Each distribution point also became an opportunity to learn, interact, and engage between people. The quality and urgency of the information distributed, and the open access to party members themselves, can be seen as a kind of wealth&mdash;not a wealth of accumulation, but a shared wealth of needs from within a struggling community.

		<img src="77.jpg" style="max-width: 75%">
			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		As a shared practice, <em>The Black Panther Party Newspaper</em> was not just a published product, but an alternative publishing economy that prioritized care and community need. This was negotiated and fulfilled collectively through acts of mutual aid. The cost of the paper was 25 cents, and sellers would keep a dime from each sale. The exchange of money enabled the newspaper to continue printing, but it also directly benefited those who labored in its production and distribution, as well as those who received the actual news.

		The form, a printed newspaper, was conventional&mdash;but every other aspect of the project challenged normative expectations, from its politics to its design to its method of distribution to its economic model to its public impact. It was <em>urgent publishing</em> in the timeliness of its delivery, and the necessity to engage and commune in the exact moment of exchange. This was radical publishing because it interfered with mainstream ideas about Black life and survival in the US, illustrating and amplifying the conversation around racial injustice. It gave voice to Black communities in crisis. It was radical publishing because the distribution of the newspaper created and benefited a mutual aid network of engaged participants who performed labor, selling (and purchasing) the paper in open, public space, interfering with the usual channels of delivery and consumption, while working against the conventions of white-controlled, white supremacist media.

			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Radical publishing has been used throughout history as a form of survival. Gestures of making public that move away from and refuse whiteness, heteronormativity, capitalism, and settler colonialism give power to deeper acts of organizing by distributing new and disruptive thinking. Radical publishing helps to define the values that enact change and to fuel that change through the publics that form around the circulation of its urgent artifacts. Projects like <em>The Black Panther Newspaper</em> and Kitchen Table and Come!Unity Press (NYC, 1970s) prioritized generosity and collaboration out of this necessity to work collectively, forming community around publishing. Focusing on communal care, and giving it form through the creation of urgent artifacts, is itself a radical act under capitalism.

We explored what it feels like to step away from the institution and work outside of traditional values in higher education, like exceptionalism, competition, and perfection; we even physically left the campus. What would it mean for a classroom to be a space for communal care? Eventually we realized that the urgency was right in the room with us, in the form of our own vulnerabilities.

			<h3>CAPTION</h3>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		At the conclusion of the class we hesitated to produce any kind of validating object or product. But we did publish this collaborative deck of cards that foregrounds the values that emerged during the semester. <em>Urgency Cookbook</em> was written and hand-drawn by everyone in the class from a collaborative doc that we worked on for several weeks, full of ingredients and recipes for survival and communal care.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">17<br>QUEER ARCHIVE WORK</h2>


    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Outside of school, I’m continuing to publish, inviting artists and writers into collaborative spaces where we prioritize queer ways of working and expression.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		These are the artists who contributed to the first issue of Queer.Archive.Work, which launched in 2018.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Here’s issue number #3. These are all unbound publications, which means everything’s loose. It’s an assemblage of prints and zines, and it can all come apart, without fixing any one narrative.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		And you can see the aesthetics of the mess are on full display here in our installation at the NY Art Book Fair last year. But it’s not just the optics of it, the look of illegibility—it’s about de-prioritizing the quick, fixed read, and empowering readers to do the work of shaping the material themselves.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We did one issue of Urgency Reader late last year, with 80 contributors, And another one this year at the start of the pandemic, just as the east coast was shutting down. This was an open call, with 110 contributors submitting work from quarantine.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		It was also a mutual aid project, using grant funding to distribute money to all of the contributors, who either accepted the compensation or donated it back to the pool.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		This was a tremendous learning experience for me, because a real community started to emerge from these publishing spaces.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		A few more shots of the risograph prints. I acquired a risograph printer recently, which has radically changed how I’m making this work. The risograph gives me the power to really control how these things are made, and how they get produced and distributed.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		This year, I decided to relocate the risograph printer in a new space and open it up for others to use, so I created a non-profit organization called Queer.Archive.Work.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		This is now a community publishing space, open to anyone but prioritizing Queer and Trans, Black, Indigenous, and POC makers who may not have easy access to traditional art world spaces.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		The heart of the space is the risograph printer as a tool of empowerment, as a way to gain control of the entire publishing process outside of traditional publishing spaces. By traditional I’m even including the so-called “alternative” or indie publishing scene, which is still so often white and cis and male and privileged.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Access to the space is always free. We’ve got this fantastic small library forming, with zines and books and examples of experimental publishing that I’ve been collecting and that people contribute to when they visit the space.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		These are just some images from our collection, which has doubled in size since we opened earlier this year.
		</p>

		    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We recently started a Download Library which lets anyone access our online time machine of indie publishing, focused mostly on urgency, radical thinking, and liberation.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		It’s still a small collection, but the PDFs in here are a treasure. I hope you spend some time with it and get inspired.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Just this week, we also launched a tool-sharing library here in Providence. This is a distributed library, meaning that all of the items are stored in our homes and work spaces, and are available for anyone to use freely.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		My dream has always been to bring financial and creative support to artists directly, so we started a series of riso residencies this summer, and it’s been a huge success.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We’re hosting 10 residents this year—half from Providence, half from outside of RI. Every month, an artist gets the entire studio for their own use, for up to 2 weeks, and a cash grant to help them with their work.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Cierra Michele Peters started us off in August. Cierra is the co-founder of Print Ain’t Dead, a bookstore of Black authors for Black readers in Boston, and she worked on starting a Print Ain’t Dead small press during her residency. She also runs these incredible Black Feminist Study Halls online, and produced a series of readers during her residency.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Next up was Sloan Leo, a NYC-based artist and designer who was in residence in September. Just before they left they had an open studio, and led one-on-one guided tours through the space, where they had produced a work called Queerbook.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		They were really performative during the residency, posting on social media every day, reflecting and using the space for rest and for growth. It was just amazing to witness. I learned so much from them.
		</p>

				    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Çaca Yvaire just finished their October residency, and right now Jayson and Laila are in the space, two local high school students who are starting a new BIPOC literary zine for RI-based teens. They originally approached QAW about printing the zine, but instead we invited them in for the whole month of November to learn about design and printing themselves. They’re really incredible.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">18<br>URGENCY AS THE SLOW, ONGOING COMMITMENT TO MAINTENANCE AND COMMUNAL CARE</h2>


    	<p class="aquamarine">
		It’s a slow process, building community. I’m learning a lot about what it means to gather, especially these days, on platforms like Slack and Instagram and Zoom. I’m learning to slow down and to let things emerge, and to work at the speed of trust, which is an expression borrowed from Adrienne Maree Brown, who writes about it in their book Emergent Strategy.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		And to really think counter-intuitively about urgency—as a slow, ongoing commitment to maintenance and communal care.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
		Too often urgency is used to exert pressure and power over a situation, so I’m looking closely at how we use that particular word and concept in publishing. How urgency might instead become a call for the slow, ongoing work of communal care, away from institutions that use speed and highly visible results as a form of gatekeeping, as a way to make thoughtful decision-making really difficult.

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">19<br>URGENTCRAFT</h2>


    	<p class="aquamarine">
		During the incredible mess of 2020, I’ve found it helpful to talk about these queer strategies of resistance and survival as a set of principles. Urgentcraft is about prioritizing anti-racism, justice, and liberation in your work. Urgentcraft exists outside of the design world, outside of brilliance, perfect legibility, otherworldly craft, extractive practices, and profit at all costs. Urgentcraft interrupts the smooth flow of design perfection. It is not an aesthetic.
		</p>

    	<p class="aquamarine">
	Do what you can
<br>
	Use modest tools and materials
<br>
	Understand the politics of your platforms
<br>
	Practice media hybridity
<br>
	Work in public (self-publish!)
<br>
	Practice a slow approach to fast making
<br>
	Think big but make small
<br>
	Redistribute wealth and accumulation
<br>
	Work towards the then and there of queer futurity (while acknowledging past struggles and privileges)
<br>
	Agitate/interfere (“make good trouble”)
<br>
	Dismantle white supremacy / be anti-racist
<br>
	Resist, loosen, and dismantle ableism, heteropatriarchy, and settler colonialism
<br>
	Resist capitalist strategies
<br>
	Refuse design perfection / stay with the mess
<br>
	Question linearity and other hierarchical structures
<br>
	Commit to maintenance and self-care as a form of urgency
<br>
	Fail to provide the perfect read (resist legibility)
<br>
	Use (steal from) the institution when you can (while resisting its values) (Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, “The University and the <br>
Undercommons”)
<br>
	Prioritize communal care as a never-ending practice

    <h2 style="color: aquamarine">20<br>A CALL TO ACTION</h2>


    	<p class="aquamarine">
		We’re faced with a kind of doom right now that sometimes feels like the end of the story. So here’s what we can do. In our own work, whether it be art, design, or otherwise: use what we have, whatever is right in front of us. Don’t wait for the next wave of crisis. Strengthen our networks now, so that when another flash point happens we’re prepared to connect, to call, and to respond, to gather, and to be in it together, whatever that means to you. Map our needs. Map our assets. What are our resources? How will we share our abundance? Be generous in how, what, and with whom we share, because in these moments of exchange, communities form. Use the urgentcraft principles, re-shape them, add to them, share them. If nothing else, keep them around, as a reminder that art and design can be used to loosen power.
