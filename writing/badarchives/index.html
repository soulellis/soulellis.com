In their erasure, we lose stories from our collective memory. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been compelled to time travel, to go back into archives, 30, 40, 50 years later, to find evidence of who and what was lost, the connective tissue between here and there.

<p>
These are ephemeral acts and public gestures, during crisis, that tell the story and spread the word, working across time, within and against erasure. Finding and learning about them is rewarding work. Sharing them is our responsibility. 

</p>

<br>

	</div>
<br>

<p>
During the AIDS crisis, in some of the same places where the most suffering was happening&mdash;New York City, San Francisco&mdash;the early internet was blooming. New kinds of relations were forming on community bulletin board services, between connected terminals, and later on, in web browsers. 

</p>

<br>
	<div class="img-container">

</h4> 
	</div>
<br>


<p>
The national context for all of this was unthinkable crisis, but we rarely think about these two together, the AIDS pandemic and the early internet. They seem to contradict each other in spirit and outcome, one a disaster and the other a dream. Within both we can trace the tangled evolution of networks and radical alternatives. 

</p>

<br>
	<div class="img-container">

</h4> 
	</div>
<br>

<p>
This was all before we knew how to preserve what we were making, and what it might mean to save these cultures that were about to go missing, for an unknown future, and why we would even need to do that.

</p>


<br>

<p>
Before we knew the full extent of the loss.
Before we knew the debt that would be incurred.

<br>

<p>
And so I go back to those early years of the network, to what&rsquo;s referred to as the digital dark age, to better understand what it felt like to search for others beyond limits, to yearn for connection, while the floor was dropping away. All of that painful searching. The simultaneous loss and connection of networks falling apart while others are being built.

Can we do this now? Can we hold these contradictions together in this same moment, here in this talk, in an attempt to expand what we know about network culture, and why that matters to us today, in our current crises?

<p>
This is a sketch, of an expanded notion of network culture, as it came into being before, during and after the AIDS pandemic. This is an attempt to re-see that history with this fuller, more painful context in mind. And from this, to learn, and to imagine better futures.

</h4> 
	</div>
<br>

<p>
Queer theory came out of that moment, emerging from the necropolitics of the Reagan Bush years, and giving us a way to look beyond chaos and crisis towards queer kinship, solidarity networks, speculative imagining. Away from heteronormativity. We got that language, given to us by Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz and others.

<br>

<p>
I&rsquo;m looking at how entangled these forces were in that moment, these messy, radical ideas about printing, publishing, networks, theory, collectivity, queerness, erasure, and futurity. I&rsquo;m looking at the affordances and failures of archival practices in crisis conditions. That is, after all, our current condition.

And so I&rsquo;d like to speak about what I&rsquo;m calling non-cooperative archival practices. Non-cooperative because these are the gestures that emerge out of urgent times, as acts of resistance. These are archival impulses that have nothing to do with the conventional archive, or archival studies.

What I learned is that printing is always political, and that printing the web changes the texture and charge of material&mdash;from impermanent to stable, from fast to slow, from visual to haptic. Printing the web signaled that all material is at risk of being lost, to never be seen again, even as it&rsquo;s held in your hands.

The printed web of the 2010s was directly connected, spiritually at least, to this: the world&rsquo;s first public computerized bulletin board system, created in 1973. It was called Community Memory,

and the first terminal was located at Leopold&rsquo;s, a record shop in Berkeley CA. Eventually there were terminals in other locations, all connected to a computer that ran the service at Resource One, a &ldquo;warehouse community&rdquo; in San Francisco.

<p>
Early in 1974, someone printed the entire thing out, everything that had ever been posted to the service. It was a desperate attempt to create a material record, working against disappearance. Now it exists as a hard-to-find set of PDFs that I managed to locate and download.

They described the project like this: &ldquo;Community Memory is community mindfulness, not-forgetfulness. In the root sense of the greek word for truth, aletheia (having come out of hiddenness) it is communal retrieve of truth, communal disclosure, that which is (left) open, by us, to us.&rdquo;

I never saw this printout when I was doing Library of the Printed Web. I wish I had; it would have changed the project. But that&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s more powerful for me now, in the work I&rsquo;m doing today, revisiting these signals from 50 years ago.

<p>
What I see in them is the queer, non-cooperative impulse to save in the midst of the flow of culture, as it&rsquo;s being lost. Queer because what&rsquo;s being gathered is often illegible to others, unworthy, not legitimate. Non-cooperative because the act of saving happens in spite of that dismissal. The bad archive forms itself in alternative spaces,

Their keyword system was chaotic, but it sort of worked. It&rsquo;s not a traditional index. It&rsquo;s not a controlled vocabulary. It&rsquo;s beautiful because it was created collectively by its users, in real time.

<p>
Two years ago, I started a non-profit organization here in Providence called Queer.Archive.Work, with a mission to do just that, to build something that comes out into the world. Within it is a collection of materials centered on voices who are typically left out of archives. QAW is porous&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bad, leaky archive that allows for seepage, the exchange, in and out, of voices and ideas, in all respects: in how we gather, in how we learn and grow, as a maker&rsquo;s space, full of tools. More than tools, like we just saw in those posts, it&rsquo;s about access to one another.

	</div>
<br>

<p>
QAW exists because of our queer ancestors who helped make network culture in all of the ways I&rsquo;ve sketched out, and our vision now benefits from that history: it&rsquo;s about gathering ideas to connect and light up the library, 

</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>
shared space where we can be in conversation with those ancestors, with those who can&rsquo;t be with us, with each other, imagining new futures, with new ideas about queerness going out into the world, through our large garage door, open to the street.

<p>
Our studio is a community memory terminal, a portal both inward and out. We can also get at this through our name, starting with the word Queer. It both welcomes and limits for whom the space serves. At QAW queerness is an expansive, limitless idea that resists definition.

<br>

<p>
We use the word Archive in our name non-cooperatively, refusing to impose classification on the materials and ideas there, for now&mdash;and challenging what we even mean by this word. We don&rsquo;t even call it an archive actually&mdash;it&rsquo;s the library&mdash;and it changes every day as different people occupy the space. We take care of zines, books, and objects, but also impulses, exchanges, needs, and desires, because it sits within a working print production studio serving a mostly local Queer, Trans, and BIPOC community.

	</div>
<br>

<p>
And we use the word Work to acknowledge the ongoing labor in alternative publishing practices, and how communal care, cooperation, and collective organizing in our space require hard work. As the burden of that work is often put upon the same people who are most oppressed racism and heteropatriarchy, much of what we do is about prioritizing equity and the fair distribution of labor, through collaboration, and cooperativism.

<p>
40 people share our studio and its printing resources&mdash;residents, members, and organizers. And every two weeks, we&rsquo;re open to the public for browsing, reading, resting, writing, discussion, connection. These different ways of accessing and serving mean that sharing happens in surprising ways. Survival by sharing.

Because it&rsquo;s a bad, leaky archive, QAW is never static. It holds space and objects and people and relations, but doesn&rsquo;t contain them. Our library&rsquo;s totally unorganized. We&rsquo;ve got more than a thousand items

<p>
that are yet to be catalogued. There&rsquo;s no way to search, and no way to track. We don&rsquo;t even have keywords. Because nothing is fixed, new relationships are constantly forming in this non-linear, bad archive.

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know how long we can keep it like this. It&rsquo;s a bad archive because its demise is always possible, always threatened by obscurity; what if it stops being useful? Online, we offer a small but significant collection of digitized zines, available for download,
