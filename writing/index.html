			<br>A new talk that I gave at Otis College: <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/urgentcraft2/" target="_blank">Urgentcraft (April 27, 2020)</a>. I spoke about mutual aid publishing during crisis, urgent artifacts, and how art and design can loosen power. This is a revision to my <a href="https://soulellis.com/work/urgentcraft/index.html" target="_blank">Urgentcraft</a> text from last summer (given at the Eyeo Festival and The Conference in Malm&ouml;), updated in response to COVID-19 and incorporating <a href="https://queer.archive.work/" target="_blank">Queer.Archive.Work</a> and <a href="https://soulellis.com/work/urgencyreader2/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Urgency Reader 2</em></a>. I shared the URL with viewers as I presented, which turned out to be a very good way to do a talk on Zoom, using the visuals on the web page to present but giving the audience the ability to follow links and spend time with resources during the talk and afterwards.</p>

			<br>With less than 24 hours remaining in 2019, I&rsquo;m reflecting on the work I&rsquo;ve produced in the last decade. And trying to gather together the writing that&rsquo;s mattered to me the most. Writing where I attempted to work something out in public. This isn&rsquo;t everything that I&rsquo;ve written, but in hindsight, these are the 20 texts that mark significant pivots in my thinking/making over the better part of a decade. They trace my wanderings here and there, and inform who I am in 2020 as an educator and an artist. I&rsquo;m excited to do more.

			<a href="https://www.documentjournal.com/" target="_blank">Document Journal</a> invited me to write <a href="https://www.documentjournal.com/2019/12/y2k-20-years-later-documents-contributors-recall-the-armageddon-that-never-was/" target="_blank">a short piece</a> about my memory of December 31, 1999. 	</p>	
<br>
<br>
			<p class="colorblock8">
			&#9761;
			<br>
			I was invited to write a brief text for <a href="http://www.felixgaertner.com/wonderful#/nlin/" target="_blank">&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s Lost In Numbers&rdquo;</a> (2019), a work by Felix G&auml;rtner and Romano Dudas, installed at Galerie Kernweine in Stuttgart, Germany (August 8&ndash;October 6, 2019). My piece was included in the installation as an email printout, pinned to the wall with the photographic works. The images were found on 31 used memory cards purchased by the artists on eBay and displayed without any permission or identification of the original authors.  
<br>
<br>
			<em>Who profits here? All signs point to artists Felix and Romano and the gallery that hosts this project. Financial, intellectual, and artistic capital will be generated by this exhibition, if all goes well. Meanwhile, what has been lost? The people who created these images and unknowingly supplied them to the artists go uncompensated and uninformed. The artists&rsquo; promise to &ldquo;reveal things that were not originally intended for the viewer&rsquo;s eyes&rdquo; does exactly that, exposing the act of grabbing property to claim as one&rsquo;s own as a classic colonialist gesture, disguised here as artistic practice. The unacknowledged collaborators may never know how their work has been used, but does it matter? The artists&rsquo; deletion of authorship, attribution, and agency remains on view in this gallery, fully exposed as an enormous debt. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s Lost in Numbers&rdquo; claims to question whether the act of deleting has any meaning in the digital realm, but goes far beyond this simple inquiry. The project replicates the loss of privacy it claims to critique, asking us instead to examine the ethics of an art world that engages in practices of neglect, invisible labor, and erasure.</em>
