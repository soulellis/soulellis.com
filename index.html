              <a href="https://queer.archive.work" target="_blank">Binch Press / Queer.Archive.Work</a> (QAW) is a cooperative print and publishing studio, a zine library, and an artists&rsquo; collective of Queer / Trans People and Black / Indigenous / People of Color. Our studio resides on unceded Narragansett land, in so-called Providence, RI. We host events, produce collective publications, print propaganda, and offer access to risograph, screen printing, and bookbinding equipment. I founded QAW as a 501c3 non-profit in March 2020; since then the project has grown rapidly from supporting 10 artists in its first year to a much-needed community hub supporting Queer and Trans life in Providence. In May 2021 QAW joined Binch Press to begin a multi-year lease at our current location in the Valley Neighborhood&mdash;a 2,000 square-foot studio housing a large array of print production resources, including risograph, screenprinting, letterpress, digital printing, and binding equipment. We&rsquo;ve now evolved to become a cooperative with 30&ndash;40 members, working as a volunteer-run organization. Members contribute to our rent by paying a monthly fee along a sliding scale, and we meet regularly to discuss all aspects of managing the studio, from community support to equipment maintenance to fundraising to organizing around social justice movements.

              <em>Survival by Sharing (scenes and provocations)</em> is a 16-page newsprint zine containing the text of a talk delivered on June 17, 2023 at <a href="http://k-s-t.org/conference25/" target="_blank">&ldquo;Publishing as a Worldview,&rdquo;</a> the 25th annual conference of the Korean Society of Typography at Platform-P, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 100 copies of the zine were printed at Binch / Queer.Archive.Work in Providence, RI and hand-carried to Seoul to distribute to the audience at the talk. The text describes a publishing ethos, told in a series of scenes, non-chronologically. It&rsquo;s a cinematic timeline, told in queer time. I reprinted <em>Survival by Sharing</em> and distributed a new edition of 50 copies at Printed Matter&rsquo;s <a href="https://sundayzinefair.org/" target="_blank">Sunday Zine Fair</a> at The Brooklyn Museum in November 2023. I plan to expand the nine scenes and 32 provocations into a larger work during my sabbatical year in 2024&ndash;25.

      <em>These Mean Images</em> (2023)
    </button>

      <img src="assets/mean2c.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>
        <em>These Mean Images</em> is a project about the (im)possibility of reparative queer history through generative image-making. During a period of several months I created thousands of photographs using a popular generative image-making tool. I wrote text prompts that asked for images of queerness at different moments in history, and I was especially interested in visualizing situations that were not possible, not allowed, or otherwise not typically included in archives. At the same time, I was generating a large collection of images that tried to visualize a real-world incident that occurred to me in October 2022, where I was injured in an accident and then remained unconscious in public for an unknown period of time. <em>These Mean Images</em> tries to locate impossible-to-see moments of vulnerability and tenderness in a blurry &ldquo;other&rdquo; reality of queer becoming. Referencing Hito Steyerl&rsquo;s <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images" target="_blank">&ldquo;Mean Images,&rdquo;</a> I remain unconvinced that these images are useful or needed; I wrote about this in <em>Survival by Sharing,</em> concluding that we need to devote more attention to the images and artifacts that are neglected all around us (in archives known and unknown). &ldquo;Mean images&rdquo; do not repair; rather, it&rsquo;s possible that they may even damage our understanding of queer history. Still, I am fascinated that they now exist, by the relative ease with which they are created, and by their power to change our collective relationship to traditional archives forever.

        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4k03h1hvmqr8ev/QAW_resting_reader.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"><em>resting reader</em></a> is a book of texts and images that I assembled from source material found on the shelves of the library at the Queer.Archive.Work shared studio. All pages were scanned directly into our risograph, printed in an unlimited edition, and bound on the studio&rsquo;s Horizon BQ-140 perfect binder. I avoided using a computer, except to set the type on the cover. The content was selected during the rise of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in December 2021, around the loose themes of rest, quiet, care, queer, sanctuary, reflection, collective, and generosity. 100 copies were distributed at the Queer.Archive.Work studio and through the mail.

        This publication is also a reflective response to my <em>Urgency Readers</em> (2019&ndash;20), and the focus on speed, crisis, and refusal in those volumes. I wrote about the process of creating <em>resting reader</em> and the power of atemporal communication with queer ancestors, both living and dead, for <em>Dear Friend</em>, the snail-mail project published by Sandra Nuut and Ott Kagovere.

          I was invited to contribute to <em>Undecimals</em>, a series of artist-organized art exchanges that&rsquo;s been ongoing in Canada since 2015. All of the art is distributed through the mail, and I was assigned August 2022 for the &ldquo;Almanac&rdquo; portion of the project. I produced <em>notes on weeds</em> as a one-page research document exploring weeds and queerness in the urban landscape.

The six-month process was highly collaborative, and culminated in the 144-page magazine-style publication, organized into two sections: &ldquo;there is no apparent system,&rdquo; and &ldquo;only a map of feeling.&rdquo; We also curated and designed a parallel exhibition at Essex Flowers in NYC in August 2022. <em>Ouroboros</em> also launched at Printed Matter&rsquo;s NY Art Book Fair in October.

        <em>Tiny Digest #1</em> is a slow, distributed-by-hand Queer.Archive.Work newsletter printed on a single sheet of cheap paper. I designed it to be assembled quickly, easily printed, and mailed out in an ordinary business envelope. I created an open call to the QAW community, resulting in 23 contributions around the theme of space&mdash;queer space, taking up space, sacred space, porous space, safe space, outer space, spaced out, shared space, screen space, etc.

        <em>What is queer typography?</em> began as a talk I delivered at the <a href="https://www.tdc.org/news/tdc-launches-global-type-drives-communities-2021-virtual-conference/" target="_blank">Type Drives Communities Conference</a>, hosted by the Type Directors Club. I researched and wrote the talk as an investigation into the roles of illegibility, agitation, and failure in typography, with the title&rsquo;s alluring question guiding an inquiry into larger practices of &ldquo;unlearning&rdquo; in art and design education. I later published the text in a zine that I designed and printed at Queer.Archive.Work, in Providence, RI. I distributed the edition through the mail during the COVID-19 pandemic, and made scans of the zine available online. This piece of writing and the ideas explored here have become one of my most referenced works. The entire zine was translated into Korean and re-published by In-ah Shin. The essay has been re-published by GenderFail Press and also appears in <em>Amalgam 4</em>. I was also invited to deliver the talk to the Queer Design Club in June 2021 [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeArgVz_5AM" target="_blank">watch it here</a>].

        All throughout the fall and winter of 2020, Queer.Archive.Work community members met weekly, on zoom. We designed simple one-hour workshops for all of us to engage in making together, never feeling like work but more like online spaces for care and play. These workshops typically involved 5&ndash;15 people. In the new year, we realized that we&rsquo;d made a beautiful queer archive of work across a range of media, including writing and drawings and images and chats. <em>QUEER MATTERS</em>, a 60-page publication&mdash;written and edited collaboratively, and designed by me&mdash;is visible evidence of our community and a joyful invitation to join us. The interior was risograph-printed at Queer . Archive . Work and the cover wrap was digitally printed at Newspaper Club. 100 copies launched for free/trade/purchase on February 24, 2021 on the occasion of Printed Matter&rsquo;s Virtual Art Book Fair, and another 100 copies were distributed by the publication&rsquo;s contributors.

        <em>TAKE IT APART</em> is a publication that I designed for the <a href="https://imagetextithaca.com/" target="_blank">Image Text Ithaca MFA Program</a> at Ithaca College in 2020 (now the <a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/art/master-fine-arts-image-text" target="_blank">Master of Fine Arts in Image Text at Cornell University</a>), with work by Andre Bradley, Hugo Gallo, Shantal Jeewon Kim, Laura Pierson, Amy Schuessler, and Kelsey Sucena. Jo-ey Tang and I worked with the group to curate their individual thesis projects and translate them to a print-based, de-centered mode of exhibition. The newsprint edition of 300 was mailed to recipients with instructions to activate the publication as a DIY installation in physical space. Students conceived of potential protocols for their individual sheets, which slide out of the folded, unbound publication. The publication was distributed in November 2020, and officially launched at Printed Matter&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/programs/events/1162" target="_blank">Virtual Art Book Fair</a> with an online performance and readings in February 2021.

      <img src="assets/screen1c.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>
        <em>Screen Zine</em> is the result of a one-hour workshop conducted online for the <a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/programs/events/1122" target="_blank">Brooklyn Art Book Fair</a> on Saturday, June 27, 2020 at 2:00PM. The workshop opened with 1-minute attunement exercises, as an experiment to gather and presence everyone into a digital screen-based space. The 20 participants then composed images and messages on their desktops for about 20 minutes. Language from <em>Urgency Reader 2</em> was provided for possible inspiration. Participants shared their screens and the desktops were captured as images. Later, those images were mixed and composed into 3-color risograph prints, and assembled into an edition of 30 zines. Each participant received a copy of <em>Screen Zine</em> in the mail. Participants: SHL, Haley Lauw, Tiyasha Ghattak, dru, truly c. strange, Allison Parrish, Julian Parikh, Emilie Baltz, Elisabeth Nicula, Zoe Welch, Paige Landesberg, Dawn S, Hannah Coleman, teke cocina, SB, corinne, Aitana Cantú, chloe zimmerman, Erick Guzman, David Kim.

      <p>
        <em>Urgency Reader 2: Mutual Aid Publishing During Crisis</em> began with a 10-day open call that I announced on March 18, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The call for work was motivated by two desires: 1&mdash;to collectively document some of the extraordinary conditions, dynamics, and emotions being experienced while in quarantine, and 2&mdash;to provide some relief to artists and writers impacted by the crisis, in both creative and monetary forms. How might I use publishing as an artistic practice to embody communal care? More than 100 artists and writers submitted work, mostly generated during quarantine. Contributors were compensated a total of $2,295, using funds from a 2020 Rhode Island State Council on the Arts grant, plus an anonymous donation. 65 of the 110 contributors donated their share of the compensation back to the pool, resulting in 45 contributors each receiving a stipend of $51. An edition of 25 hand-numbered copies of <em>Urgency Reader 2</em> was printed and assembled at Queer.Archive.Work during the first week of April 2020, and printed copies were sold to collectors in order to fund the first round of QAW riso residences. The final 278-page publication was a loose assemblage of 129 prints, folded sheets, and zines, wrapped with rubber bands and contained in a plastic bag.

      <em>URGENCY READER 1</em> (2019)
    </button>
      <img src="assets/reader1c.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>
        <em>Urgency Reader</em> is a quick assembling of texts that I risograph printed and bound as a book in Pawtucket, RI, and launched at the <a href="https://artgallery.yale.edu/calendar/events/odds-and-ends-art-book-fair-0" target="_blank">Odds and Ends Art Book Fair</a> at Yale University Art Gallery. Suggested topics from the open call included urgency, craft, queerness, gender, transformation, kinship, race, survival, post-apocalyptic practice, futurity, pedagogy, surveillance capitalism, death of capital, radical publishing, decolonization, augmentation, resistance, sci-fi, collective care, and joy. Inspired by <a href="https://www.artecontemporanea.com/product/16192/" target="_blank"><em>Omnibus News #1</em></a> (1969), <a href="https://artistsperiodicals.blogspot.com/2012/07/assembling.html?m=1" target="_blank"><em>Assembling</em></a> (1970&ndash;87), and other assembling publications, <em>Urgency Reader</em> was an experiment in publishing as a gesture of call and response: the quick circulation of a charged collection of texts&mdash;in some cases raw, in-progress, or sketchy&mdash;to a small but deeply engaged audience. As Karl Young <a href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/art/sp000177.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> in his foreword to <em>Assembling #12</em>, such publications &ldquo;can be read as chance-generated collages, and as spontaneous pieces of printed performance art.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A total of eighty contributors far and wide sent 467 pages of work in just under two weeks, signaling a need to publish urgently, but less preciously, on non-corporate platforms. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I used my stapler&rsquo;s maximum capacity to determine the page count (126 sheets + cover bound with 5/8 inch staples). The goal of the edit was to be as inclusive as possible, at times asking contributors to compact their submissions in order to free up space for others. The order of the texts as they appear in the book was determined by chance by assigning a series of random integers from random.org to the alphabetical list of contributors. The edition was 110 copies.

      <em>URGENTCRAFT</em> (2019)
    </button>
      <img src="assets/craft1c.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>
        <em>URGENTCRAFT</em> is a set of principles that works to resist oppression-based design ideologies, especially in art and design education. <em>URGENTCRAFT</em> isn&rsquo;t a manifesto, but rather a constellation of tactics&mdash;a series of incomplete observations; a note to self. This is a reminder that we can use art and design to loosen hegemonic power. The print was originally made to accompany the talk &ldquo;URGENCRAFT,&rdquo; delivered at the Eyeo Festival in June 2019 (and revised in April 2020 for <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/on-the-power-of-mutual-aid-publishing-during-crisis/" target="_blank"><em>The Creative Independent</em></a> in response to COVID-19). The talk outlines these principles and provides examples of artists and writers who manifest these ideas. It was reprinted as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1f6k4zd3zechozs/UC_5.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">a zine</a> in an edition of 200 in August 2019 and included in <em>QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK #3</em> for distribution at Printed Matter&rsquo;s NY Art Book Fair.

      <em>Let us affirm our desire to keep swimming.</em> (2019)
    </button>
      <img src="assets/swimming1c.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>
        <em>LET US AFFIRM OUR DESIRE TO KEEP SWIMMING</em> is a collaborative publication authored and produced by the students of Urgency Lab Ithaca, a 2-week course that I taught at Image Text Ithaca in July 2019. The zine is an assemblage of printed materials containing dreams, demands, and agreements that evolved during the class, over the course of eight 3.5-hour sessions. The students produced an edition of 45 that was distributed on July 11 during a performative reading at Ithaca College. The class began with the distribution of a non-linear syllabus. Each student received a deck of 51 cards, in an edition of 10, that I risograph printed in Pawtucket, RI. The cards contained prompts, concept words, readings, and other provocations that were shuffled and rearranged and rewritten by the students, with my guidance. The class evolved out of these early discussions about how to spend our time, leading to collective agreements and activities that emerged organically from the group.

Upon receipt, the publication e x p a n d s in the hands of its reader, filling an enormous space with queer feeling. It shapes a landscape that speaks of visibility, of a commitment to pleasure, of kinship networks, of memory, of closely re-written histories, of engaged dialogue, of riptides, of affective space beyond the material, of a failed, imperfect read. My goal for this publication was to model communal care as a never-ending practice.

        <em>Queer.Archive.Work 2 (1923 Internet Archive Edition)</em> was installed in a special reading room at the <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> in San Francisco on January 25, 2019. Printed as an edition of 100, the publication is a newsprint catalog enclosing a set of annotated risograph prints, allowing lesser-known material from 1923 to intermingle in a loose assemblage. Artifacts include rare, historical LGBTQIA+ content that I made available for the first time in digital format, and works by Black and Native American artists and writers. All items were originally published in 1923 and were in the public domain as of January 1, 2019. I edited and produced <em>Queer.Archive.Work 2</em> as an artist-in-residence at the Internet Archive, and it was included as part of the Archive&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/12/05/join-us-for-a-grand-re-opening-of-the-public-domain-january-25-2019/" target="_blank">celebration of the newly-expanded public domain</a>. I was invited to speak about the project during the celebration and addressed 1,000 guests with <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/01/25/queer-archive-work-2-1923-internet-archive-edition/" target="_blank">a short talk about the project</a>.

        This was the first project that I ever produced on a risograph (digital printing on newsprint was also used). Originally conceived as &ldquo;Printed Web #6&rdquo; and later changed to <em>Queer.Archive.Work #1</em>, this publication was the start of the ongoing Queer.Archive.Work project. Everything assembled in this issue was unbound: no staples, glue, or clips were used. The nine parts of the publication are held together using folding, nesting, and enveloping. Sheets may be pulled out and rearranged, encouraging new juxtapositions and relationships each time it&rsquo;s read. An edition of 300 was printed in my studio in Pawtucket, RI and launched at the 2018 NY & Boston Art Book Fairs. A second edition of 60, featuring Allison Parrish, was featured at the <a href="https://techzinefair.org/" target="_blank">NY Tech Zine Fair</a> in December 2018.

        This project&mdash;a broadcast, a book, and a download&mdash;restores access to 1,964 climate change-related URLs that were removed from EPA.gov on April 28, 2017. The URLs point to web pages, documents, and other files that were purged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the direction of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and the Trump administration. Some of the assets had been accessible on the web since 1997. The April 28 purge redirected hundreds of climate change URLs to one of three new pages: &ldquo;This page is being updated,&rdquo; &ldquo;Complying with President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order on Energy Independence,&rdquo; or the scrubbed &ldquo;Energy Resources for State, Local, and Tribal Governments.&rdquo; The <em>Steve, Harvey and Matt,</em> website broadcasts the entire collection of climate change URLs ten times each day&mdash;a randomized mix of restored access and empty gestures. The 734-page printed book contains all of the EPA emails and spreadsheets that detail the purge, obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests.

        <em>Thank you for your interest in this subject</em> contains a selection of 22 web pages that I collected from whitehouse.gov. The publication presents the last (Obama) and first (Trump) views of the official White House website as cached by the Internet Archive on January 20, 2017, as the Obama administration transitioned to the Trump presidency at approximately 5:00pm. Pages of content related to Civil Rights, Women&rsquo;s Rights, Immigration, Climate Change, LGBTQIA+ Rights, and others were removed and replaced with the message: &ldquo;Thank you for your interest in this subject.&rdquo; In 2018 the Trump administration redesigned whitehouse.gov and replaced the entire site with new visual language and content, and the placeholder page, as it was archived in this publication, was permanently removed (as was the original Obama-era content).

        I started <em>Library of the Printed Web</em> in 2013 as a way to investigate web-to-print artistic practice and the increasingly ﬂuid relationship between screen and printed page. It was at first a small collection of mainly self-published artists&rsquo; publications that I acquired directly from artists and small publishers who were interrogating network culture through print media. The collection quickly grew, attracted attention, and became the subject of international exhibitions, workshops, research, and discourse. In 2014, I began publishing my own artists&rsquo; publications through <em>Library of the Printed Web</em> (<em>Printed Web</em> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and <em>Printed Web Editions</em>), regularly featuring new work by a range of web-to-print artists in various print-on-demand forms.
       </p>
       <p> 
        By 2017, <em>Library of the Printed Web</em> had evolved to become an important resource for the study of print-based experimental publishing in the early 21st century. The collection was acquired by <a href="https://library.moma.org/" target="_blank">The Museum of Modern Art Library</a> in New York in January 2017.

A comprehensive <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2gha026gyk5uugp/LotPW-MoMA_design_final_lo.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">catalogue</a> was published in fall 2017, with contributions by me, David Senior and Sarah Hamerman of MoMA Library, and artist Sal Randolph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Library of the Printed Web entered MoMA Library as a self-contained collection (<a href="https://library.moma.org/discovery/search?query=any,contains,Library%20of%20the%20Printed%20Web,AND&tab=MoMA&search_scope=MoMA&vid=01NYA_INST:MoMA&mode=advanced&offset=0" target="_blank">including its own MoMA call number designation: &ldquo;LPW&rdquo;</a>), to be preserved in its entirety for years to come. The project is available for institutional loan, and accessible to the general public at MoMA&rsquo;s midtown Manhattan location for viewing and research (by appointment). Many of the works are rare or no longer available. Most are self-published, including handmade, one-of-a-kind, limited editions, as well as many print-on-demand works.

      <p>
        <em>Prompts for 24-Hour Light</em> was a teaching tool created for &ldquo;Artistic Practice in 24-Hour Light,&rdquo; a 3-week summer travel course that I taught in Reykjav&iacute;k, Iceland for Rhode Island School of Design in 2017. Artist <a href="http://salrandolph.com/" target="_blank">Sal Randolph</a> and I designed the instructional score as a single-sheet newsprint publication that was distributed to the students. They used the score to self-generate prompts that would become the basis for exploratory projects that they developed during the trip, which were then shared publicly in an installation and happening at <a href="https://mengi.net/" target="_blank">Mengi</a> that occurred on the final evening of the course.

          Eva_script is the result of a one-night reading residency on December 16, 2016 in the former apartment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Hesse" target="_blank">Eva Hesse</a> (134 Bowery, 3rd floor, NYC), hosted by <a href="http://dispersedholdings.net/" target="_blank">dispersed holdings</a>. During the residency, I created an instructional score using fragments of text from Hesse&rsquo;s diaries and closely-cropped images of Hesse taken in the apartment. The printed artifact was generated during a three-way performative session between me, Sal Randolph, and David Richardson, on December 17, 2016. Each of the participants, positioned in different rooms, activated the &ldquo;protocol of the document&rdquo; in silence over the wifi network. The site-specific collaborative work was entirely conceived, generated, printed, and installed in Hesse&rsquo;s apartment. <em>Eva_script</em> is included in the book <em>Reading Room</em>, published by dispersed holdings (ed. David Richardson), 2020 in a first edition of 300 copies.

          I created <em>LaRossa Mix</em> as an instructional score for generating a publication, inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Mix" target="_blank">Williams Mix</a> (1951&ndash;53) by John Cage. The content draws from three categories of content (A, B, C) drawn from eight openly accessible web-based archives and data sets. The publication may be any size and contain any number of pages. To begin, the number, type, and order of web objects is chance-determined. A single search term is used to generate the first data pull. Residual terms, coordinates, numbers and other elements generated by each search are used to feed subsequent searches, from one object to the next, until all web objects have been collected. Then, &ldquo;it is the business of the artist to arrange the objects in order, 2&ndash;3 objects per page, as desired. Incorporate all residue into publication. Produce a small edition and give away all copies.&rdquo;

Each &ldquo;room&rdquo; or department of the museum was a print-on-demand artist&rsquo;s book of a different size and material. Assembled, the 22 self-published books constituted a variable floor-plan which visitors could explore. The <em>ABCEUM</em> publications launched at Printed Matter&rsquo;s NY Art Book Fair in 2014. Special museum display cases were constructed for the project and it went on to be exhibited at (and acquired by) various institutions, including Brighton Photo Biennial, Offprint Paris, FRAC Poitou-Charentes, and Bavarian State Library.

<p>
        My room was not a room at all but the museum&rsquo;s presence on the network, which I imagined as <em>NEW MEDIA</em>, a 32-page print-on-demand newsprint publication that documented the first 420 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@realwebdrivertorso/videos" target="_blank">videos</a> posted to YouTube by the user <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webdriver_Torso" target="_blank">Webdriver Torso</a>. <a href="https://library.moma.org/permalink/01NYA_INST/90vked/alma991010726089707141" target="_blank">A copy of <em>NEW MEDIA</em> is held at Museum of Modern Art Library (LPW S673 A12n) as part of the Library of the Printed Web acquisition.</a>

        <em>530 (S&aacute; veldur sem &aacute; heldur)</em> is a site-speciﬁc book work completed at <a href="https://neslist.is/" target="_blank">Nes</a>, an artist&rsquo;s residency in Skagastr&ouml;nd, Iceland (July&ndash;September 2013). The book expresses a series of connected encounters with people, places, things, and data in the remote ﬁshing village. 530 refers to the village&rsquo;s population (according to Wikipedia), as well as a number that appears on the 1955 fishing trawler Hafr&uacute;n docked in Skagastr&ouml;nd&rsquo;s harbor. It is also the number of pages in the book.
</p>
<p>
        &ldquo;S&aacute; veldur sem &aacute; heldur&rdquo; is an Icelandic expression that a village resident used in conversation to describe the future of the town, in relation to its once-rich sea resources. It roughly translates to &ldquo;the one who holds it is the one who is responsible.&rdquo; I adopted the expression to refer to the book form itself, in the hands of the reader.

        The work was created using a score of 39 &ldquo;movements&rdquo; that were arranged by chance operations. The sections move in and out of each other, sometimes overlapping or merging. <em>530</em> was printed by Svansprent in Reykjav&iacute;k, in an edition of 50. Most of the books were given away in a series of book encounters in the town during my ﬁnal week in residency. Copies of <em>530</em> are in the artists&rsquo; books collections at Reykjav&iacute;k Art Museum, the library of Nylo (Living Art Museum, Reykjav&iacute;k), the Skagastr&ouml;nd Public Library, and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

      <p>
        <em>Las Meninas</em> was a photo publication containing a series of 17 images that depict the photographer and/or camera&rsquo;s reflection visible in mirror or glass. I extracted all of the images from Google Street View using the &ldquo;interior view&rdquo; function. The relationship between image-maker, viewer, frame, and apparatus is ambiguous, and plays out differently from scene to scene. The series suggests hidden (as well as revealed) connections to power both inside and outside the frame. In <em>Las Meninas</em> the re-framed mirror presents a utopian ideal (the perfect view(er) of commerce) as well as heterotopian uncanniness (the displaced, disembodied, powerless view(er)), recalling Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s <em>Las Meninas</em> (1656). <a href="https://library.moma.org/permalink/01NYA_INST/90vked/alma991010659569707141" target="_blank">A copy of <em>Las Meninas</em> is held at Museum of Modern Art Library (LPW S673 A12 m) as part of the Library of the Printed Web acquisition.</a>

        <em>Chancebooks</em> was a publishing-on-demand experiment using Wikipedia and chance operations. Each <en>Chancebook</en> was a one-of-a-kind assemblage of up to 100 randomly pulled articles from Wikipedia. The selection and sequence of content was generated in real-time as I repeatedly clicked the &ldquo;random article&rdquo; button that appears on all Wikipedia pages, and added each individual page to the book. The total number of articles was determined by pulling a random number (1&ndash;100) at random.org. The title is selected from the list of article titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only one copy of each Chancebook exists, printed on-demand and delivered to me. The book&rsquo;s design was automated and determined by the print-on-demand service. Included within each book are my location and exact date and time of the book&rsquo;s creation. <em>Chancebook #1 (Why Does It Hurt So Bad)</em> [39 articles] was created in Long Island City, New York, USA at 2:29pm on March 26, 2013 and delivered on March 29, 2013.

      <img src="assets/apparition2c.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>
        <em>Apparition of a distance, however near it may be</em> is a collection of found images that reveal Google Books employees physically interacting with books inside the digital space of the book scanner. The collection is gathered into a 42-page print-on-demand publication. As accidental recordings, the images mistakenly add human physicality, movement, and distortion to the experience of consuming static books in browsers. These anomalies are usually corrected or removed algorithmically, but sometimes errors remain, becoming spectral additions to the Google Books library and permanently altering the viewer&rsquo;s perception of the content. I search for these mistakes and work with them as found photography. They expose deviations in the algorithms hiding deep within the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a printed book work, <em>Apparition of a distance, however near it may be</em> proposes value in the extended translation of print to digital, and then back to print: a wider view of the book as an object that exists simultaneously in digital and physical realities.

        <em>Weymouths</em> was a 12-part book work investigating place, identity, and memory in Weymouth, Dorset (England) and Weymouth, Massachusetts (USA). The project was conceived as an archive and installed and performed as a series of public book encounters during the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad in Weymouth, England (site of the Olympic sailing competitions). <em>Weymouths</em> was a commission for b-side Multimedia Arts Festival and funded by Arts Council England. Each morning, 20 books were given away at various locations around town&mdash;one volume per day. 240 books were distributed during 12 days. All of the books were free, but several people gave objects, books, notes, stories, and art in return. Each afternoon, the entire set of 12 books was accessible to the public in a reading room installation above the bakery at the center of town.

        As an archive, <em>Weymouths</em> is an open reliquary of first-hand accounts, third-person memory and collective identity. The books are bound containers holding public domain texts, historical records, lists, archival imagery, photography, tweets, interviews, maps, color, Google Street View, Wikipedia, and other raw source materials that were assembled into real and imagined narratives. As a performance, <em>Weymouths</em> enabled the creation of a spontaneous community through the simple act of giving away books. Each public book encounter between artist and audience became an excuse for conversation, as new stories expanded the work in real-time. As a social networking experiment, <em>Weymouths</em> enabled the formation of new connections, bonds, and relationships between artist and audience.

      Stetson is an experiment in geo-historical typography. The single-weight face was drawn from a very small sample of 19th century hand-drawn letterforms, found within an old photograph in a shed in Weymouth, Massachusetts. In the photo, the sample &ldquo;E. H. Stetson and Co.,&rdquo; is surrounded by a display of shoes. Not far from where the photograph was found is the actual Stetson Shoe Co. factory building, which operated in Weymouth from 1885 until 1973. The Stetson typeface is in a kind of spatio-temporal duet with its own history: it locates itself within the original photograph (late 19th-century New England), as well as in the shed on January 11, 2012. The letterforms vibrate in time and space.

It&rsquo;s a cinematic timeline, told in queer time. The piece was originally commissioned as a talk for the Korean Society of Typography, delivered on June 17, 2023 at their conference &ldquo;Publishing as Worldview,&rdquo; in Seoul, Republic of Korea. It was then published in the book <em>LetterSeed 24 New Season: Publishing as a Worldview</em> in September 2023. I also published the text as an edition of 50 zines, which were distributed in Seoul. Another edition of 50 was re-printed and distributed freely at Printed Matter&rsquo;s Sunday Zine Fair at The Brooklyn Museum on November 19, 2023.

            &ldquo;Dear Friend&rdquo; (2022)
      </button>
        <p>
            <em>Dear Friend</em> (2019&ndash;2022) was a monthly snail-mail project initiated by Sandra Nuut and Ott Kagovere at the Graphic Design Department of the Estonian Academy of Arts. The publication began as an edition of 100 and later 200 letters each month, which were riso-printed and hand-folded in a collaborative manner. Half of the edition was distributed locally and another half globally, traveling to design institutions, schools, and professionals. My contribution describes the making of <em>resting reader</em> and includes a QR code link to download a PDF of the publication, and was sent out as volume 34 in February 2022. Later in 2022 the entire project was documented in the book <a href="https://lugemik.ee/Dear-Friend-Catalogue" target="_blank"><em>Dear Friend Catalogue</em></a>, published by Lugemik.

        <p>
         <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/tdc2021/" target="_blank">&ldquo;What is queer typography?&rdquo;</a> was written as a talk that I was invited to deliver at the Type Drives Communities Conference, hosted by the Type Directors Club. I researched and wrote the talk as an investigation into the roles of illegibility, agitation, and failure in typography, with the title&rsquo;s alluring question guiding an inquiry into larger practices of &ldquo;unlearning&rdquo; in art and design education. I later published the text in a zine that I designed and printed at Queer.Archive.Work, in Providence, RI. I distributed the edition through the mail during the COVID-19 pandemic, and made scans of the zine available online. This piece of writing and the ideas explored here are one of my most referenced works. The entire zine was translated into Korean and re-published by In-ah Shin. The essay has been re-published by GenderFail Press in <a href="https://printedmatter-linkedbyair.herokuapp.com/catalog/59728/" target="_blank"><em>Anthology of Queer Typography Vol. 1</em></a>  and also appears in Pouya Ahmadi&rsquo;s <a href="https://i-n-g-a.com/products/amalgam-4" target="_blank"><em>Amalgam 4</em></a>. <a href="https://www.printmag.com/designer-interviews/what-is-queer-typography/" target="_blank">An interview with me</a> about the zine was published in <em>PRINT Magazine</em> in August 2021.

      &ldquo;On the power of mutual aid publishing during crisis&rdquo; (2020)
      </button>
        <p>
          The Creative Independent published a version of my Urgentcraft text in June 2020, at the height of the initial COVID-19 pandemic. This version includes a very direct &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; at the end:
        </p>
          <blockquote><em>We&rsquo;re faced with a kind of doom right now that sometimes feels like the end of the story. So here&rsquo;s what you can do, in your own work, whether it be art, design, or otherwise: Use what you have, whatever is right in front of you. Don&rsquo;t wait for the next wave of crisis. Fortify your networks now, so that when another flashpoint happens you&rsquo;re prepared to connect, to call, and to respond, to gather, and to be in it together, whatever that means to you. Map your needs. Map your assets. What are your resources? How will you share your abundance? Be generous in how, what, and with whom you share, because in these moments of exchange, communities form. Use the urgentcraft principles, re-shape them, add to them, share them. If nothing else, keep them around, as a reminder that art and design can be used to loosen power.</em></blockquote>

In 2020, during the initial COVID-19 pandemic, I was invited to give talks on a regular basis, and I reworked the Urgentcraft talk repeatedly to account for the changing conditions. <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/urgentcraft2/" target="_blank">This version</a> was written for Otis College of Art and Design on April 27, 2020, and <a href="https://soulellis.com/writing/urgentcraft3/index.html" target="_blank">this version</a> was written for a talk hosted by Wendy&rsquo;s Subway on the occasion of their online residency with the Libby Leshgold Gallery and READ Books, at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, Canada.

          <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/01/25/queer-archive-work-2-1923-internet-archive-edition/" target="_blank">This text</a> was originally written as a brief talk given at the Internet Archive&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grand Re-opening of the Public Domain&rdquo; on January 25, 2019, co-hosted by Creative Commons. It was later published on the Internet Archive&rsquo;s blog. The piece reflects my time at the Internet Archive for an artist&rsquo;s residency, our collective responsibility to perform archival justice, and the making of the second issue of Queer.Archive.Work, which I published and distributed for this event.

        <p>
          When I was invited by Sam Hart, Melanie Hoff and Francis Tseng to speak at the Cybernetics Conference in NYC on November 18, 2017, I decided to continue my thinking around network culture and the phenomenon of the feed, which I had begun earlier with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/87357zg9g61rtm7/Notes-on-Feeds.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">&ldquo;Notes on Feeds.&rdquo;</a> <a href="https://livestream.com/internetsociety2/cybercon" target="_blank">The entire conference livestream is available here.</a> This piece was later published by Rhizome in its Seven on Seven 10th Anniversary Magazine <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6i2wxlrhgwo389v/whats_to_be_done.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"><em>What&rsquo;s To Be Done?</em></a> in May 2018, edited by Nora Khan.

      <em>Notes on Feeds</em> (2017)
      </button>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Notes on Feeds&rdquo; was a piece that I wrote to accompany <em>Printed Web 5: Bot Anthologia</em>, which launched simultaneously at Interrupt 4 at Brown University, where I delivered the talk, and at Trust and Believe at Eyebeam, in Brooklyn, a one-day event organized by Nora N. Khan and Sam Hart, where the publication was being distributed. This was the first essay where I sketched out ideas about the post and the feed as forms in network culture, which I further developed in subsequent writings. I self-published the essay as a newsprint broadsheet that was distributed along with <em>Printed Web 5</em>.

          In 2014 I was selected to be in the inaugural cohort at NEW INC at the New Museum, in NYC. For the year, I used NEW INC as my studio, and my desk was located next to the Rhizome editorial team. This was fortuitous; after learning about my work and ongoing conversations about digital art, I began writing for Rhizome, which eventually led to my serving as a Contributing Editor. I wrote a total of 13 pieces during a two-year period. 11 are included here, and 2 others are located elsewhere on this page (The Download: sorry to dump on you like this.zip and Digital Publishing, Unzipped).

      </button>
        <p>
          For the launch of Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke&rsquo;s <em>3D Additivist Cookbook</em>, I was invited to speak and participate on <a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/programs/events/544" target="_blank">a panel at Printed Matter on December 2, 2016</a>. Since the editors were releasing the book as a special &ldquo;3D PDF,&rdquo; I used this opportunity to write a short performative talk about the history of the PDF and the qualities of &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; and &ldquo;embeddedness&rdquo; in contemporary publishing&mdash;asking the question: &ldquo;What if the letter carries the pigeon?&rdquo; The book itself &ldquo;is a free compendium of imaginative, provocative works from over 100 world-leading artists, activists and theorists. <em>The 3D Additivist Cookbook</em> contains .obj and .stl files for the 3D printer, as well as critical and fictional texts, templates, recipes, (im)practical designs and methodologies for living in this most contradictory of times.&rdquo; My essay &ldquo;The Distributed Monument&rdquo; is included in the book.

I was invited to participate by leading a workshop and delivering a talk about experimental publishing for the artists, curators, and museum officials who were preparing for the opening of the new building. The talk is organized into four sections&mdash;1 Is posting publishing? 2 Malls, bedrooms and balconies, 3 Designing the place of memory, and 4 Poor media and physical space. Later, these efforts led to the realization of <a href="https://www.lafayetteanticipations.com/fr/latelier-dedition" target="_blank">The Publishing Workshop</a>.

          Hyperallergic invited me to publish a piece on their site to accompany my presentation at <a href="http://artfcity.com/2014/12/07/hypersalon-a-gem-amongst-the-miami-fairs/" target="_blank">Hypersalon</a>, which took place at Art Basel Miami in December 2014. This essay builds on &ldquo;Search, compile, publish&rdquo; and goes deeper into the concepts I was beginning to explore with Library of the Printed Web. I had just started publishing <em>Printed Web</em> and the essay discusses specific examples of digital art that appear in issues 1 and 2. Soon after, I presented this essay as a talk at <em>Interrupt 3</em>, a literary conference held at Brown University in March 2015.

          This essay is having a long life. I initially wrote it as a talk that I presented at <a href="http://www.theblogazine.com/2013/06/the-book-affair-at-venice-art-biennale/" target="_blank">The Book Affair</a> in Venice, Italy in May 2013, held on the occasion of the 55th Venice Art Biennale. At that event, which was held outside in the courtyard of the Biblioteca di Castello in San Lorenzo, I displayed examples of artists&rsquo; publications that I had collected for Library of the Printed Web, and described the kinds of methodologies that may have gone into creating them. A few months later, I published the text as a newsprint broadsheet and distributed an edition of 500 copies at Printed Matter&rsquo;s 2013 NY Art Book Fair by leaving them in a pile at the entrance to MoMA PS1; they disappeared within hours.

          In June 2016, I updated the essay and delivered it as a talk at the Miss Read art book fair in Berlin, organized by Michalis Pichler. Pichler later included the essay in the first (beta) edition of his book <a href="https://missread.com/publication/publishing-manifestos-beta-version/" target="_blank"><em>Publishing Manifestos</em></a>. When it was <a href="https://missread.com/publication/publishing-manifestos/" target="_blank">re-published by MIT Press</a> in March 2019, my essay was again included.

          Soulellis is also the founder of Library of the Printed Web, a physical archive devoted to web-to-print artists’ books, zines and other printout matter. The collection of 250 works was acquired by The Museum of Modern Art Library in New York in 2017.

His work is in special collections at The Museum of Modern Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Whitney Museum of American Art; Walker Art Center; Yale University; Tate Britain; and many other institutions.
