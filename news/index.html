			I&rsquo;m launching <a href="https://queer.archive.work/2/index.html">QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK 2 (1923 INTERNET ARCHIVE EDITION)</a> on January 25, 2019 as a special edition of 100 copies, distributed in a reading room at the Internet Archive in San Francisco. This second edition of QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK is a newsprint publication and set of risograph prints that focuses on lesser-known material from 1923&mdash;including rare, historical LGBTQ content that has been digitized for the first time. This publication is being produced while I&rsquo;m artist-in-residence at the Internet Archive for January 2019, and is part of the Archive&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/12/05/join-us-for-a-grand-re-opening-of-the-public-domain-january-25-2019/" target="_blank">celebration of the newly-expanded public domain</a>.
