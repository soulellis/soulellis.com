			<br>I was recently interviewed about <a href="https://soulellis.com/work/lotpw/index.html">Library of the Printed Web</a> for a new book, <a href="http://www.bnn.co.jp/books/9914/" target="_blank"><em>Speculations: Beyond Human-Centric Design</em></a>, published by BNN Japan, 2019. The book is an index of 99 design research projects, with my work appearing in the Next-Network section, grouped into an Archive sub-section along with The Serving Library, AAAARG/The Public School, All Possible Futures, and A Museum for Collective Memory.

			<br>I recently issued an <a href="https://queer.archive.work/reader/" target="_blank">open call</a> to see how fast I could assemble, print, bind, and publish a collection of work around these themes: &#8889;urgency, &#8889;craft &#8889;queerness &#8889;gender &#8889;transformation &#8889;kinship &#8889;race &#8889;survival &#8889;post-apocalyptic practice &#8889;futurity &#8889;pedagogy &#8889;surveillance capitalism &#8889;death of capital &#8889;radical publishing &#8889;decolonization &#8889;augmentation &#8889;resistance &#8889;sci-fi &#8889;collective care &#8889;joy. It&rsquo;s an experiment in call and response that has me scrambling to give form to a remarkable collection of texts that suddenly appeared out of nowhere. <a href="https://soulellis.com/work/urgencyreader/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Urgency Reader</em></a> launches on December 6 at <a href="https://artgallery.yale.edu/calendar/events/odds-and-ends-art-book-fair-0" target="_blank">Odds and Ends Art Book Fair</a> at Yale University Art Gallery.
