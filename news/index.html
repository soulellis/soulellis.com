	I was invited by AIGA Los Angeles to create a 2-week online workshop with <a href="http://mjbalvanera.com/index.html" target="_blank">MJ Balvanera</a>, resulting in a collaborative risograph publication to be produced in Providence and Mexico City, and distributed from Los Angeles. <a href="https://losangeles.aiga.org/event/work-less-workshop/" target="_blank">&ldquo;work/less workshop&rdquo;</a> took place over 8 days (October 2&ndash;9, 2021) with 20 participants, who allowed us to interrupt their work-week with prompts for spontaneous creating, generating creative &ldquo;non-work&rdquo; that challenged normative expectations around time, labor, and career. The publication is in production and will be ready by the end of 2021.

	<br>
	<br>
	&ldquo;The brief rainbow-ification of corporate logos and merchandise every June left us wondering what a more radical vision of queer design would look like. That&rsquo;s why Paul Soulellis&rsquo;s zine, &lsquo;What Is Queer Typography?,&rsquo; caught our eye. Soulellis is an associate professor of graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design and the director of a nonprofit publishing studio and residency called Queer.Archive.Work that provides space and resources to artists for print projects.&rdquo;

			I&rsquo;ll be an artist-in-residence at the <a href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> from January 7–26, 2019. I&rsquo;m using my time there to begin work on <a href="https://queer.archive.work" target="_blank">QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK</a> #2. I&rsquo;ll also explore their <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/" target="_blank">newly available public domain content from 1923</a>, searching for queer material to be exhibited at the Archive, and for possible inclusion in #2. If you&rsquo;re an artist / writer / educator using queer methodologies in your practice and would like to meet-up while I&rsquo;m in town&mdash;please <a href="mailto:paul@soulellis.com">reach out</a>!   </p>

			<a href="http://queer.archive.work">QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK</a> is a new series edited and published by Paul Soulellis, featuring new work by Jack Halberstam, Nora N. Khan, American Artist, Somnath Bhatt, Nicole Killian, Nate Pyper, shawn&eacute; michaelain holloway, Unity Press, Be Oakley, Sal Randolph, Porpentine Charity Heartscape, and Demian Din&eacute;Yazhi&acute;. The publication is urgent, messy, and future-looking, and the first in a new series. It includes a small collection of print-on-demand and risograph zines and prints, a &ldquo;loose assembling&rdquo; of queer methodologies, with a particular view towards network culture, failure, and refutation. QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK #1 is available at the Boston Art Book Fair, October 12&ndash;14, where Soulellis will give the talk &ldquo;Publishing as Practice as Resistance,&rdquo; 1pm, Saturday, October 13. </p>
