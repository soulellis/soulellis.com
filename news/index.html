			<a href="http://queer.archive.work">QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK</a> is a new series edited and published by Paul Soulellis, featuring new work by Jack Halberstam, Nora N. Khan, American Artist, Somnath Bhatt, Nicole Killian, Nate Pyper, shawn&eacute; michaelain holloway, Unity Press, Be Oakley, Sal Randolph, Porpentine Charity Heartscape, and Demian Din&eacute;Yazhi&acute;. The publication is urgent, messy, and future-looking, and the first in a new series. It includes a small collection of print-on-demand and risograph zines and prints, a &ldquo;loose assembling&rdquo; of queer methodologies, with a particular view towards network culture, failure, and refutation. QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK #1 is available at the Boston Art Book Fair, October 12&ndash;14, where Soulellis will give the talk &ldquo;Publishing as Practice as Resistance,&rdquo; 1pm, Saturday, October 13.
